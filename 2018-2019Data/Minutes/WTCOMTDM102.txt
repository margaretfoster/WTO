ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
&& The Director of the Development Division recalled that Members had been informed at the 101st Session on 14 March 2017 that a meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) would be convened to elect the new Chairperson of the CTD, and the new Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on Least Developed Countries (LDCs), once there was consensus on the slate of names to serve as Chairpersons of WTO bodies. He went on to say that, at the General Council meeting of 7 April 2017, the names of the WTO Chairpersons for 2017 had been announced. Accordingly, the purpose of the present meeting was to allow the Committee to elect the Chairperson of the CTD – who had been announced at the General Council meeting to be Ambassador Taonga Mushayavanhu of Zimbabwe – and the Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on LDCs. As for the regular substantive items which normally appeared on the CTD's agenda, these would be taken up at the 103rd Session.
&&The draft agenda as contained in document WTO/AIR/COMTD/10 of 3 May 2017 was adopted. 
&&ELECTION OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT

&& The Committee elected Ambassador Mushayavanhu as the Chairman of the CTD for 2017.
&& ELECTION OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON LEAST-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
&& The Chairman recalled that Members were informed at the 101st Session that, on the basis of consultations, the name of Ambassador Monique van Daalen of the Netherlands had emerged as the candidate to serve as Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on LDCs. 
The Committee elected Ambassador van Daalen as the Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on LDCs for 2017.

__________
 In the draft agenda, the item concerning the election of the Chairperson of the Sub-Committee appeared before the item concerning the election Chairperson of the CTD, as per the practice. However, in light of the absence from the meeting of the CTD Chairman for 2016 (H.E. Mr. Christopher Onyanga Aparr of Uganda), the Committee agreed to first proceed with the election of the new CTD Chairman, who thereby chaired the meeting.
