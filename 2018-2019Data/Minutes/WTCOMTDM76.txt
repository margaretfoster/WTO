ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
&& The Chairman said that the draft agenda for the 76th Session of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) was contained in document WTO/AIR/3420 issued on 15 September  2009.  He drew Members' attention to a recent notification by Switzerland concerning its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) scheme.  This notification of 7 October 2009, which had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/7/Add.3, would be considered by the CTD at its last meeting of 2009.
The agenda was adopted.
OBSERVERS
Request for attendance of ad hoc observers
&& The Chairman recalled that, at previous sessions of the CTD, Members had agreed to invite a number of intergovernmental organizations on an ad hoc, meeting-by-meeting basis.  These included the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), the Inter‑Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the African Union (AU), the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the South Centre, the Pacific Islands Forum, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).  He said that, following the decision taken at the previous meeting of the Committee, the organizations had been invited to the present meeting.  He proposed that the organizations be invited to the next formal meeting of the CTD.
It was so agreed.
Further consideration of the requests for observer status by the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting, the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, the Common Fund for Commodities, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) and the Groupe de la Banque Africaine de Développement
&& The Chairman said that at previous meetings, the Committee had had before it a number of requests for observer status.  He said that if there was no change in positions to extend observer status to any of those applicants, then the Committee would take note and would revert to those requests at the next meeting.
It was so agreed.
NOTIFICATIONS UNDER THE ENABLING CLAUSE
&& The Chairman said that he wished to provide Members with an update on the regional trade agreements (RTAs) notified under the Enabling Clause that were to be considered in the CTD's Dedicated Sessions on RTAs.  He firstly recalled that he had indicated at the CTD's Third Dedicated Session on RTAs that the Chile-India Agreement could be considered at a Dedicated Session to be held back-to-back with the last Regular CTD of the year, if outstanding data and comments requested from India were provided in good time.  India had, however, yet to provide the Secretariat with comments on the draft Factual Presentation.  In view of this, the Factual Presentation on the Chile‑India Agreement had not been circulated.  The implication was that the consideration of the Agreement would need to be postponed to 2010.  There would, therefore, be no more meetings of the Dedicated Session on RTAs in 2009.  Members would be kept informed of when the Chile-India Agreement would be taken up for consideration.
He also recalled from his earlier interventions that there were three RTAs involving non‑WTO Members that had been notified under the Enabling Clause, and that would need to be considered by the CTD meeting in Dedicated Session.  These were the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), the India-Bhutan Agreement and the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA).  With regard to the consideration of these Agreements, he said that the data provided by the Parties concerned remained very limited.  For SAFTA, only data from Bangladesh had been received.  No data had been received from the Parties to the other two Agreements.  While it was still envisaged that the three Agreements could be considered in a Dedicated Session of the CTD in May 2010, this would depend on whether the Parties to the Agreements were able to provide the data soon. 
&& 	GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (GCC) NOTIFICATION OF CUSTOMS UNION (WT/REG222/N/1 AND CORR.1, WT/COMTD/N/25, WT/COMTD/66 AND ADD.1 TO ADD.3)
&& The Chairman recalled that it had been agreed at the last CTD meeting that this item would remain on the agenda for the present meeting.  He said that he wished to report to the CTD what had been conveyed to him on a possible way forward on this matter.  He recalled that, on 3 October 2006, the GCC Customs Union had been notified to the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) under Article XXIV of the GATT 1994 and the Understanding thereon.  The notification was circulated in document WT/REG222/N/1.  The GCC Agreement was subsequently notified to the CTD under paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause.  This notification, of 19 November 2007, was circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/25. 
He informed the Committee that Saudi Arabia had re-notified the Agreement under Article XXIV of the GATT 1994 and the Understanding thereon.  This notification, of 6 October 2009, was circulated in document WT/REG276/N/1.  His understanding was that the GCC Agreement would be considered in the CRTA in accordance with the provisions of the 14 December 2006 General Council Decision on a Transparency Mechanism (TM) for RTAs, and that the conclusion of this consideration would be reported to the CTD for informational purposes.  This process for the consideration of the GCC Agreement would be undertaken without prejudice to the rights and obligations of Members under GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause.  On the basis of this way forward that had been conveyed to him, he proposed that the item concerning the GCC notification be taken off the CTD's agenda.
&& && The representative of India said that his delegation had been following discussions on this matter very closely in the CTD, as well as in the CRTA.  In India's view, it was the prerogative of the GCC countries, which were all developing countries, to determine whether to notify their Agreement under GATT Article XXIV or under the Enabling Clause.  His delegation welcomed the fact that the concerned Members had been able to resolve the matter concerning the notification of the Agreement.  He indicated, however, that this should not prejudice the rights of other developing country Members to notify their RTAs under the Enabling Clause, if they so chose. 
He referred to Section E of the RTAs TM, which dealt with the bodies entrusted with the implementation of the Mechanism.  He noted that the CRTA was to implement the Mechanism for RTAs falling under Article XXIV of GATT 1994 and Article V of the GATS, while the CTD was to implement the Mechanism for RTAs falling under paragraph 2(c) of the Enabling Clause.  In view of this, it was amply clear that if an RTA was notified under GATT Article XXIV, the CRTA would be the body implementing the Mechanism, while for an RTA notified under the Enabling Clause, the implementing body would be the CTD.  His delegation wished to ask the Secretariat whether or not the notification of the Agreement under the Enabling Clause had been withdrawn.
&& The representative of Egypt said that his intervention under this agenda item was without prejudice to what had been agreed with respect to the GCC Customs Union notification.  His delegation believed that there were some systemic issues that needed to be clarified.  These related in particular to the dual notification – under GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause – of an RTA between developing countries, with the indication that the Agreement was to be considered in the CRTA while the CTD was only to take note of this consideration.  Part of the clarification required was on the procedural front, but part of it also had legal implications.  He recalled his delegation's suggestion at the last CTD meeting that the Secretariat could update its 2003 Legal Note on Regional Trade Arrangements under the Enabling Clause, as contained in document WT/COMTD/W/114.  He believed that a revision of the document would assist Members in clarifying the respective roles of the CRTA and the CTD in the consideration of RTAs, in particular since the establishment of the TM for RTAs.
&& The representative of China said that his delegation saw the compromise reached on the GCC notification as an exceptional case, which should not undermine the rights and obligations of developing country Members – including the GCC countries – under the Enabling Clause.  In addition, it should not constitute a precedent for any other notifications by developing country Members.  China shared the systemic concerns raised by India and Egypt on the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union, and encouraged the Chairman to hold informal consultations on this issue.
&& The Chairman invited the Secretariat to respond to the query from India. 
A representative of the Development Division said that, at present, the notification of the GCC Customs Union under the Enabling Clause had not been withdrawn.
&& The representative of India said that, in light of the obvious systemic implications, and unless further clarity was provided, his delegation wished to retain this item on the agenda for the CTD's next meeting.  India also supported the request by Egypt for an update to the Secretariat's Legal Note on Regional Trade Arrangements under the Enabling Clause.  Discussions at the present meeting lent support to the need for an update to the document.
&& The Chairman said that Egypt's request for a revision to the Secretariat's Legal Note on Regional Trade Arrangements under the Enabling Clause had been noted.  He also proposed that the Committee take note that the GCC Customs Union would be considered in the CRTA.  The present item would, however, remain on the agenda for the next CTD meeting. 
&& The representative of the United States said that her delegation was slightly confused about what had been said under this agenda item at the present meeting.  She was not sure whether it was the systemic issue of an Enabling Clause notification, as opposed to a notification under GATT Article XXIV, that would remain on the CTD's agenda.  In any case, it appeared to her that a submission by one or more delegations would have to be made for the purpose of placing a matter on the agenda of a Committee.  In this light, she did not see how the present item could continuously appear on the CTD's agenda.
In response to the intervention by the United States, && the representative of India said that he had already referred to the RTAs TM, which made clear that the CRTA would be the implementing body for RTAs notified under GATT Article XXIV, while the CTD would be the implementing body for RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause.  In the case of the GCC Customs Union, notifications had been made under both Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause.  His delegation believed that the CTD needed to look into this issue.  It was for this reason that India had requested that the present item remain on the agenda for the CTD's next meeting.
&& The Chairman said that, as he saw it, the concerns raised related to the fact that the notification under the Enabling Clause remained.  He had not, however, heard any delegation object to the choice made by the GCC countries to notify their agreement under GATT Article XXIV and have it considered in the CRTA.  According to the process that he had outlined in his earlier intervention, the CTD would then be informed of the outcome of this consideration.  In that sense, the matter would in any case not be completely removed from the CTD's horizon. 
&& The representative of Egypt indicated that a distinction needed to be made between the procedures relating to Members' consideration of the GCC Customs Union, and the systemic concerns raised by some delegations.  With regard to the GCC Customs Union, the CTD would need to come back to it once the CRTA had completed its consideration of the Agreement.  However, this process in itself would not address the systemic issues that needed to be clarified.  In light of the need to clarify the systemic issues, he suggested that the present item remain on the CTD's agenda.
&& The representative of the United States said that Egypt had made a useful distinction between practical issues and systemic issues.  On the practical front, she said that the RTAs TM gave the Secretariat the responsibility to assemble the facts on a particular agreement, regardless of whether the agreement was considered in the CRTA or in the CTD.  With regard to systemic issues concerning the application of the RTAs TM, she suggested that these would best be addressed in the Negotiating Group on Rules.
&& The Chairman inquired whether, in light of the US' intervention, delegations still wished to maintain this item on the agenda for the CTD's next meeting.
&& The representative of India said that his delegation was of the view that the CTD needed to discuss this issue at its next meeting.
&& The representative of China supported India's view.
&& The Chairman said that the item would remain on the agenda for the CTD's next meeting. 
It was so agreed.
DECISION ON TRANSPARENCY FOR PREFERENTIAL TRADE ARRANGEMENTS (WT/L/672)
&& The Chairman said that the 14 December 2006 General Council Decision on "Transparency for Preferential Trade Arrangements" – contained in document WT/L/672 – invited the CTD to consider transparency for preferential arrangements under paragraph 2 of the Enabling Clause – other than RTAs – and report back within six months for appropriate action by the General Council.  The Council had since extended the deadline to its December 2009 meeting.
He said that he had recently held a small-group informal consultation to take stock of where discussions stood on the establishment of a TM for Preferential Trade Arrangements (PTAs).  The proponents – Brazil, China, India and the US – had informed the group that they were close to finalizing a revision to their draft proposal, and that the revised proposal would be circulated shortly.  As he had informed Members on previous occasions, he intended to have the revised proposal – once circulated – considered in an informal, open-ended CTD meeting.  He also recalled that he had  informed Members that the Secretariat was in the process of preparing a "mock" Factual Presentation of a PTA, based on the GSP scheme of the United States.  The "mock" had now been finalized, and copies were available at the back of the meeting room.  He expressed his hope that this document would help move the process forward.  While some initial comments on the "mock" had been made in the small-group informal consultation that he had called, he appreciated that more time would be required for the membership as a whole to consider the document.  He would, therefore, invite comments on the "mock" at the informal, open‑ended CTD meeting that he would be calling to consider the proponents' revised proposal.  He believed that the "mock" would be best considered in conjunction with the revised proposal.
&& The representative of the European Communities said that the "mock" gave insight into how the proposed PTAs TM might work, but also raised a number of questions.  Some questions were more of a practical nature, concerning for example the structure and content of the "mock".  There were, however, also some wider implications that would need to be explored in conjunction with the proponents' revised proposal.  He added that his delegation was interested in seeing how the factual guide – referred to in paragraph 7(b) of the current version of the proposal – would look, as well as how information concerning a PTA would be reflected in the database on PTAs that was to be established.  Finally, he welcomed the Chairman's initiative to call an informal, open-ended meeting once the proponents' revised proposal was circulated.          
&& The Chairman said that the "mock" was meant to serve as an illustration of how the proposed PTAs TM might work, but was not the main document under consideration.  It was the proponents' revised proposal which would be the focus of discussions in the informal, open-ended meeting that he would be calling.  He  reminded Members that he would need to report to the General Council on this matter in December 2009, and expressed his hope that the CTD would have come to a decision by then.  He said that he would continue to work with Members, and would also open up the matter for discussion once again at the last CTD meeting of the year.  This item would, therefore, remain on the CTD's agenda.
It was so agreed.
REVIEW OF STEPS TAKEN TO PROVIDE DUTY-FREE AND QUOTA-FREE MARKET ACCESS TO LEAST-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES	
&& The Chairman said that an item concerning the Hong Kong Decision on duty-free and quota‑free (DFQF) market access for LDCs had been on the CTD's agenda since early 2006.  Under this item, delegations had provided information on the steps they were taking, or had already taken, to provide DFQF market access to LDCs.  Written communications by some Members had also been considered.  He recalled that the CTD had to date undertaken three of its mandated annual reviews of the implementation of the Hong Kong Decision.  
&& The representative of Switzerland referred to his delegation's GSP notification of 7 October 2009, which had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/7/Add.3.  The notification concerned the provision of DFQF market access by Switzerland.  He said that his delegation would formally introduce the notification at the CTD's last meeting of the year.  
&& The representative of the European Communities said that he wished to provide an update on the EC's Everything but Arms (EBA) initiative for LDCs.  The EBA initiative, established in 2001, incorporated a number of transitional provisions concerning the imports of bananas, rice and sugar.  In particular, duty-free market access was provided to LDCs under a gradually expanding quota regime, which had now been terminated.  Therefore, from 1 October 2009, the EBA initiative granted full DFQF market access for all products – except arms and ammunition – from all LDCs.  He added that the EC Heads of State had, in September 2009, invited G-20 members – which included both developed and developing countries – to put in place an initiative similar to the EBA in order to support people in developing countries suffering from the current economic crisis.
&& The representative of Zambia acknowledged the recent GSP notification by Switzerland.  She also recognized the support that the EC was providing to LDCs through the EBA initiative.      
&& The Committee took note of all interventions. 
TECHNICAL COOPERATION AND TRAINING
-	BIENNIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING PLAN 2010-2011 (WT/COMTD/W/170/REV.1)
&& The Chairman said that the Biennial Technical Assistance and Training Plan for 2010 and 2011 (TA Plan) had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/170/Rev.1.  He invited the Secretariat to introduce the Plan.
&& The Director of the Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation (ITTC) said that consultations on the TA Plan had been taking place since March 2009.  Through these consultations, the Secretariat had made every effort to make the Plan respond to the requests that had been made and the concerns that had been raised by Members.  This made it a truly a demand-driven Plan.  On the basis of lengthy discussions with Members, some changes had been introduced into the Plan to ensure that the WTO's technical assistance (TA) activities were efficient and facilitated the building of capacity in developing countries.  He cited as examples the notion of progressive learning, and the efforts that were being made to ensure that all participants in a given activity had a similar level of knowledge.  Finally, he thanked the Arab countries, the Caribbean countries, and the Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucus (CEECAC) countries for their understanding that, due to limited resources, three-month training courses could not be organized for them in the 2010-2011 biennium.  It was hoped that all regions would benefit from the same regional training activities by 2012.      
The Head of the Trust Fund Unit said that she would present an overview of the Secretariat's cost estimates for the TA Plan.  She referred to document CRP(09)20.Rev.2, which summarized the financial implications of the Plan.  The cost estimates followed the structure of the Products Matrix that could be found on pages 50 to 66 of the English version of document WT/COMTD/W/170/Rev.1.  She said that the WTO, in the delivery of TA, was dealing with increasing and changing demands within the constraints of the available human and financial resources.  In light of this, the TA activities were being based on the needs formulated by the beneficiaries.  Cost-sharing arrangements with partner institutions in the organization of training courses in the various regions and sub-regions were also being implemented. 
Globally, the total estimated cost of the TA Plan was CHF 30.4 million for 2010 and 2011, which was to be financed from the regular budget, the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF) and other trust funds.  TA activities to be financed from the regular budget amounted to CHF 5.1 million for each year of the biennium.  She noted that the figures relating to the parts of the regular budget allocated to TA were provisional, pending the examination of the budget proposals by the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (CBFA) and the approval by the General Council.  She added that the proposed regular budget funds allocated to TA were lower than the CHF 5.5 million allocated in 2009.  Geneva-based training activities included in Chapters A and B were financed out of the regular budget, as were the majority of the national activities included in Chapter B.  The Geneva-based long training courses, which originated in the 1950s, were still the WTO's flagship TA product financed from the regular budget.  Provisions had also been made for shorter specialized courses to be financed with regular budget resources.
With regard to the TA activities that were to be financed from the DDAGTF, she said that the Plan's progressive learning approach would not entail additional costs, since continuous emphasis was being placed on partnerships and cost-sharing arrangements with other institutions.  The regional balance, volume and scope of activities had been adjusted to better respond to the needs identified by the beneficiaries, but the estimated cost of the activities contained in the Plan, and the requiring financing from the DDAGTF, had been maintained at the same level of CHF 24 million.  This amount was identical to what had been asked of donors since 2003.  In arriving at this amount, the Secretariat had applied the same standard cost methodology as in the previous years for calculating the cost of the regional, national and Geneva-based activities included in Chapters A, B, and C.  The methodology used the standard daily costs per person for these activities, which were updated annually based on the actual costs incurred in the preceding 12 months.  The daily standard cost was then multiplied by the number of persons to be invited to take part in the event and by the number of days, in order to arrive at the total cost of a particular activity.  As the average rate of participation was never 100 per cent, a no-show discount of 30 per cent had been applied to the cost estimates for 2010 and 2011.  The estimated costs of the three-month Regional Trade Policy Courses (RTPCs) included in Chapter A, on the other hand, had been based on actual costs incurred in the previous year.  She explained that the cost structure of these courses were different from the other regional activities, whose costs were estimated using the standard cost methodology.
On e-training, she said that the main cost component concerned human resources, in other words, the team running the online courses.  This cost element was included in Chapter F, along with the L-Posts and other short-term positions required to give the Secretariat the additional human resources needed to implement the Doha Development Agenda.  Finally, the cost-sharing arrangements with the WTO's partners had been factored in, and the 13 per cent overhead charge had been added to arrive at the total projected cost of the activities to be financed from the DDAGTF.  With regard to trainee programmes and internships, the existing Netherlands Trainee Programme would continue until the end of 2011 thanks to the multi-year pledge of the donor.  It was expected that the internships for selected Members' missions in Geneva would continue at the same level as in previous years.  These programmes appeared under the column heading "Other".
Finally, she recalled that, according to the General Council's decision on the operation of the DDAGTF, the CTD and the CBFA were to jointly supervise the Fund and be responsible for a process whereby they would:  (i) review and endorse the TA Plan and its estimated cost;  (ii) recommend an annual target level for the DDAGTF to the General Council;  and (iii) keep the execution of the Plan under periodic review.  In this regard, she said that she would report back to the CBFA on the results of the discussions in the CTD.
&& The representative of China said that the TA Plan set out a clear roadmap for the WTO's activities in this area over the next two years.  China was ready to adopt the Plan and to work with the Secretariat in its effective implementation.  He referred to paragraph 7 of the Plan which, inter alia, pointed out that one of the main challenges in executing the TA Plan continued to be its financing and, more specifically, ensuring timely and adequate levels of funding.  In this regard, he said that China had recently contributed US$200,000 under the Aid-for-Trade initiative, which was to be channelled into TA activities.  He encouraged developed country Members to deliver their commitments in a timely and adequate manner so as to ensure that the TA Plan could be implemented smoothly.
&& The representative of the European Communities said that her delegation fully supported the revised TA Plan as contained in document WT/COMTD/W/171/Rev.1.  She also welcomed the budget-related document that had been made available to Members.  The budget breakdown greatly helped in understanding the weight of each of the planned TA activities, and to assess more concretely how the contributions to the DDAGTF would be used in practice.  The information would help in preparing contributions to the DDAGTF before the start of the activities, thereby ensuring that there would be no gaps in financing.
&& The representative of Iran said that his country, as an acceding country, attached great importance to the wide range of TA activities provided by the WTO.  Iran believed that the provision of reliable expertise to the acceding countries would, among other things, greatly ease the accession process.  He welcomed the forthcoming Geneva-based seminar for all acceding governments, but also requested the Secretariat to seriously consider organizing a similar initiative at the regional level for CEECAC countries, given that 11 of these countries were in the process of accession.  He added that the CEECAC countries had missed the opportunity to benefit from an advanced trade policy course in 2009, but hoped that they would be able follow such a course in the near future.  This would help better harmonize regional and sub-regional activities for the CEECAC countries, particularly in view of their heterogeneity and different needs.  As for the different courses provided on a regional and sub-regional basis, his delegation believed that there was a need for a more equal distribution of training possibilities, in terms of both the topics and the duration of the courses.
&& The representative of Bangladesh said that his country was a beneficiary of national, regional and Geneva-based TA activities.  While Bangladesh had no problem with the TA Plan, he said that he wished to make a comment on the coordination process.  When the WTO requested nominations to particular activities, a communication was sent to the Bangladeshi mission in Geneva, which forwarded the request to the capital.  The nomination was then sent to the ITTC.  His concern related to the ITTC's procedures to respond to the nomination.  In particular, a rejection of a nomination was communicated to the Geneva mission, while the acceptance of a nomination was communicated directly to the candidate – without informing the mission.  In spite of having had several discussions with the ITTC, the process still continued.  He wished to know what the problem was, and why the mission could not be copied on communications concerning the acceptance of a nominee.  He also wished to know what was the percentage share of LDCs in the 2010-2011 TA Plan relative to the previous one.
&& The representative of Japan expressed his delegation's hope that the TA Plan, combined with Aid for Trade more generally, would help developing countries build capacity to participate in international trade.
&& The representative of Cameroon appreciated that the TA Plan demonstrated the importance of beneficiaries organizing themselves at the national level in order to gain full benefits from the activities. 
&& The representative of Burkina Faso said that the TA Plan was a very clearly written document.  He hoped that donors would continue to provide assistance to help developing countries build their trade-related capacity. 
&& The representative of Uganda asked for clarification with regard to the application process to benefit from the outreach activities for parliamentarians and civil society.
&& The representative of Nigeria appreciated that the TA Plan was truly demand-driven.  He encouraged the Secretariat to liaise closely with missions in the preparation of national activities in order to ensure that the activities requested were implemented as soon as possible.  
&& The representative of Lesotho appreciated the value of the internship and trainee programmes. He said that he would have liked to see more funding made available for these programmes.   
&& The Director of the ITTC agreed with the representative of Lesotho that the internship and trainee programmes were important, particularly for LDCs and for missions that did not have sufficient staff to follow all the areas of negotiation.  He said that consultations were taking place with some donors on the possibility of providing more funding for this purpose.  On the question raised by Uganda, he said that the ITTC was working closely with the Information and External Relations Division (IERD) on activities concerning parliamentarians.  Requests for such activities could be sent either to the ITTC or to the IERD.  He informed the Committee that, in addition to national activities, regional activities for parliamentarians were being planned.  He agreed with Bangladesh that the missions in Geneva should be kept informed of all decisions regarding nominations.  While all efforts were being made in this regard, he indicated that he was willing to explore any scope for improvement.  On Bangladesh's second query, he said that there had been progress in the share of LDCs in the 2010-2011 TA Plan relative to the previous one.  The LDCs remained the priority in the WTO's TA activities.    
&& The Committee adopted the Biennial Technical Assistance and Training Plan for 2010 and 2011. 
DRAFT ANNUAL REPORT 2009 (WT/COMTD/W/171)
&& The Chairman said that the CTD's draft annual report for 2009 was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/171.  The document contained the annual reports of the CTD in Regular Session, the CTD's Dedicated Sessions on RTAs and Small Economies, the Sub-Committee on LDCs, as well as the CTD's report of its work on Aid for Trade. 
He recalled that he had informed Members at the CTD's 75th Session that the Committee's annual report was being issued earlier than was usually the case.  This was in light of the Seventh Ministerial Conference, which would be held from 30 November to 2 December 2009.  The draft report before the Committee, once adopted, would be forwarded to the General Council for consideration at the Council's November meeting.  The General Council would forward the annual reports of all Councils and Committees under it to the Ministerial Conference.  He added that the CTD's last meeting of the year would be held after the Ministerial Conference.  In order to reflect the CTD's full range of activities in 2009, an addendum to the annual report would be circulated for adoption by the CTD at its last meeting of the year.  The addendum would be forwarded to the General Council for consideration at the Council's December meeting.  
He observed that the draft report contained a number of square brackets relating to items under consideration at the present meeting, as well as at the 20th Dedicated Session on Small Economies and the 12th Session on Aid for Trade.  As part of the process of adopting the report, the square brackets would be removed, and the discussion that took place at these meetings would be appropriately reflected in the report.  He opened the floor for any comments on the draft report.
&& The representative of the United States indicated that it would be necessary to reflect in the final annual report the outcome of the discussion concerning the TA Plan.  She explained that her delegation had an interest in the Secretariat circulating a budget relating to particular items listed in the Plan.    
&& The representative of the European Communities proposed that paragraph 8 of the draft report be updated to reflect the re-notification of the GCC Customs Union under GATT Article XXIV, as contained in document WT/REG276/N/1.  He also asked the Secretariat to check whether the LDC Ministerial Conference organized by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) was indeed scheduled to be held on 3 and 4 December 2009, as was mentioned in paragraph 35 of the draft report.
&& The Chairman said that the comments from Members on the draft report would be incorporated, as necessary, in the CTD's final report.  He proposed that the Committee adopt the report.
&& The Committee adopted its annual report for 2009.
