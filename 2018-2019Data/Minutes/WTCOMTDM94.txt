&&The Director of the Development Division said that the 94th Session of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) was being held to elect the new Chairperson of the CTD. He recalled that the Chairman of the General Council had informed Members at the Council meeting of 5 May 2015 of the departure from Geneva of Ambassador Bassirou Sene of Senegal. In this light, the General Council Chairman had indicated that he would be holding consultations with Members for the appointment of a new CTD Chairperson. In a fax dated 22 May, the General Council Chairman informed Members of his understanding that there was consensus among delegations on the appointment of Ambassador Juan Esteban Aguirre Martínez of Paraguay as Chairman of the CTD. Subsequently, in a fax sent to Members on 27 May, the General Council Chairman had confirmed that Ambassador Aguirre could be appointed CTD Chairman at the next formal CTD meeting. The purpose of the present meeting was, therefore, to formally elect Ambassador Aguirre as Chairman. As for the regular substantive items which normally appeared on the CTD's agenda, these would be taken up at the 95th Session.
The draft agenda as contained in document WTO/AIR/COMTD/2 of 18 May 2015 was adopted.
