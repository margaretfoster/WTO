ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
&& The Chairman said that the 66th Session of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) would focus on technical cooperation issues, and in particular the Biennial Technical Assistance and Training Plan (TA Plan) for 2008 and 2009.  He said that the draft agenda for the meeting was contained in document WTO/AIR/3111 issued on 2 November 2007. 
The agenda was adopted.
OBSERVERS
Request for attendance of ad hoc observers
&& The Chairman recalled that at previous sessions of the CTD, Members had agreed to invite a number of intergovernmental organizations on an ad hoc, meeting-by-meeting basis.  These included the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), the Inter‑Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the African Union (AU), the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the South Centre, the Pacific Islands Forum, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).  He said that, following the decision taken at the previous meeting of the Committee, the organizations had been invited to the present meeting.  He proposed that the organizations be invited to the next formal meeting of the CTD.
It was so agreed.
Further consideration of the requests for observer status by the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting, the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, the Common Fund for Commodities, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) and the Groupe de la Banque Africaine de Développement
&& The Chairman said that at previous meetings, the Committee had had before it a number of requests for observer status.  He said that if there was no change in positions to extend observer status to any of those applicants, then the Committee would take note and would revert to those requests at the next meeting.  
It was so agreed.
TECHNICAL COOPERATION AND TRAINING
-	BIENNIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING PLAN – 2008-2009 (WT/COMTD/W/160)
&& The Chairman invited the Deputy Director-General responsible for development issues to present the TA Plan for 2008 and 2009. 
The Deputy Director-General recalled that the Secretariat had provided a short summary of the TA Plan at the 65th Session of the CTD on 8 October 2007.  She was now pleased to inform Members that the Plan had been issued as document WT/COMTD/W/160 of 2 November 2007.  The Plan addressed a number of issues relating to support in trade capacity building, including issues concerning predictability, stability in the design and implementation of technical assistance (TA) activities, and the provision of a sound financial basis for the delivery of the activities.  The Plan built on experience and lessons learned from the implementation of previous plans and on the recommendations made during the 2006 Strategic Review of the WTO's trade-related technical assistance (TRTA) activities.  She said that in addition to the challenge of enhancing predictability in securing the necessary funding for the TRTA activities, some of the other main challenges in the delivery of TA concerned the continued strengthening of the synergies between training and technical cooperation;  improving the quality of the activities;  enhancing the training material and the course content;  consolidating needs assessments as a basis for the provision and delivery of TRTA;  the continued strengthening of strategic cooperation with partner agencies;  building on experiences with the use of e-Training;  and ensuring appropriate follow-up to the training events.  
She highlighted the usefulness of the e-Training Programme, which allowed a maximum number of government officials from developing countries to gain in-depth knowledge of WTO areas.  The programme also allowed an improvement in the selection process of participants for TA activities.  She informed the Committee that a very positive response had been received from many developing countries to the e-Training Programme.  In particular, 1,915 participants from 123 developing country Members and Observers had participated in 18 e‑Training online courses in 2007.  
She said that the TA Plan contained some flexibility to ensure that the programmes and the activities could be adjusted to take into account the evolving realities and developments in the multilateral trading system, as well as the evolving needs of beneficiaries.  The key underlying objective of all the activities contained in the Plan was to support developing countries' efforts to better integrate into the multilateral trading system, by providing them with the necessary knowledge, expertise and capacity to participate actively in the Doha negotiations and to benefit from the opportunities provided by the system.  Priority would continue to be given to least-developed countries (LDCs), including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) and other specific programmes designed for them. 
She informed the Committee that a TRTA webpage called 'Building Trade Capacity' had been designed and launched, and could be accessed through the WTO website.  The webpage contained specific information on activities, eligibility and how to participate.  It also provided more visibility to the extra-budgetary contributions used to finance TRTA programmes.  She said that while a biennial technical assistance plan required a biennial budget, Members were free to make their contributions annually if they preferred.  Continued efforts were being made to address the financial issues relating to the TA Plan from a systemic angle.  She expressed her hope that the TA Plan could be adopted at the present meeting, so as to leave sufficient time to submit it first to the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (CBFA) for budgetary approval, and then to the General Council.  This would permit the implementation of the Plan to begin as of January 2008.
&& The Chairman invited a representative of the Budget and Control Section of the Secretariat's Administration and General Services Division to provide some information of the budgetary aspects of the TA Plan  for 2008 and 2009.
&& The representative of the Budget and Control Section said that the cost estimates being presented at the present meeting followed the structure of the Products Matrix that could be found on pages 48 and 49 of the English version of the TA Plan and the list of activities that started on page 50.  She referred to document CRP(07)12.Rev.1, which summarized the financial implications of the TA Plan.  Globally, the total estimated cost of the TA Plan was CHF 30.8 million and CHF 30.1 million for 2008 and 2009, respectively, to be financed from the regular budget, the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF) and other trust funds.  Technical assistance activities to be financed from the regular budget in each year of the biennium amounted to CHF 5.5 million.  The Geneva‑based training activities included in Chapter A were financed in most part out of the regular budget, which was also the case for slightly more than half of the national activities included in Chapter B.  She noted that the figures relating to the parts of the regular budget allocated to TA were provisional, pending the examination of the budget proposals by the CBFA and approval by the General Council. 
She said that the planned volume and scope of TA activities to be financed from the DDAGTF in the next biennium was approximately the same as in 2007.  Consequently, the estimated cost of the activities contained in the TA Plan that required financing from the DDAGTF had been maintained at the same level of CHF 24 million.  This amount was identical to what had been asked of donors since 2003, with the main objective of trying to improve the value for money at the same cost.  In arriving at this total cost of CHF 24 million for the DDAGTF, the Secretariat had applied the same standard cost methodology as in previous years for calculating the cost of the regional, national and Geneva-based activities included in Chapters A, B, and C.  This methodology used the standard daily costs per person for the activities, which were updated annually based on the actual costs incurred in the preceding 12 months.  The daily standard cost was then multiplied by the number of persons to be invited to take part in the event and by the number of days, in order to arrive at the total cost of a particular activity.  As the average rate of participation was never 100 per cent, a no-show discount of 25 per cent had been applied to the cost estimates for 2008 and 2009.  The estimated costs of the three-month Regional Trade Policy Courses (RTPCs) included in Chapter A, on the other hand, had been based on actual costs incurred in the previous year.  She explained that the cost structure of these courses were different from the other regional activities, whose costs were estimated using the standard cost methodology. 
Provisions had also been made for Reference Centres and e-Training. The main component of the costs related to e-Training concerned human resources, in other words the team running the online courses.  This cost element was included in Chapter F, along with the L-Posts and other short‑term positions created in order to give the Secretariat the additional human resources needed to implement the Doha Development Agenda.  Finally, the cost-sharing arrangements with some of the WTO's partners had been factored in, and the 13 per cent overhead charge had been added to arrive at the total projected cost of the activities to be financed from the DDAGTF.  With regard to trainee programmes and internships, she said it was expected that the existing Netherlands Trainee Programme and the internships for selected Members' missions in Geneva would continue at the same level as in the previous years.  These programmes appeared under the column heading entitled "Other". 
In providing an update of the financial situation of the DDAGTF, she said that, as of 31 October 2007, funds in the DDAGTF amounted to CHF 22.5 million.  Three more contributions totalling CHF 3.1 million were expected before the end of the year.  Once these contributions were received, the target amount of 24 million would be reached and exceeded by a small margin.  She, however, drew Members' attention to the terms of reference of the DDAGTF, which required that 100 per cent of the annual target amount be in the bank by the end of June.  She noted that this deadline had been missed in both 2006 and 2007, leading to disruptions in the implementation of the technical assistance plan in the first semester.  She went on to say that at the projected level of total expenditures for 2007 – assuming that the pledged contributions were received before the end of the year – funds remaining in the DDAGTF were expected to be approximately CHF 5 million.  Should the CTD and the CBFA approve the TA Plan and its proposed target maintained at CHF 24 million, she explained that CHF 5 million was less than the 25 per cent of the annual target amount for the following year that was required to be received by 31 December, according to the terms of reference of the DDAGTF. 
She recalled that, according to the General Council's decision on the operation of the DDAGTF, the CTD and the CBFA were to jointly supervise the Fund and be responsible for a process whereby:  (i) the CTD would consider and endorse the Plan;  (ii) the CTD and CBFA would jointly cost the Plan and recommend an annual target level for the DDAGTF to the General Council;  and (iii) the CTD and CBFA would jointly keep the execution of the Plan under periodic review.  In this regard, she said that she would report back to the CBFA on the results of the discussions in the CTD.
&& The Chairman opened the floor for questions and comments.
&& The representative of Cuba said that he sought some clarification on paragraphs 240 to 242 of the TA Plan.  He noted in particular that a mention was made in paragraph 240 of the Plan to the possibility of transferring some of the activities from the DDAGTF to the regular budget.  In this regard, he inquired whether such a transfer would entail some changes in Members' contributions to the regular budget.  He also noted that paragraph 242 highlighted that one of the implications of such a transfer would be a loss of overhead revenues of 13 per cent of the amount that would be transferred.  He asked for some clarification as to why this would occur.
&& The representative of Uganda, on behalf of the African Group, said that the WTO's TA activities were highly appreciated by the Group.  The Group supported the adoption of the TA Plan for 2008 and 2009 and the continuation of technical assistance activities for developing countries and LDCs. 
&& The representative of Canada said that his delegation supported the move to a biennial approach, as this would allow for the longer-term consideration of capacity building in beneficiary countries, as well as a more effective participation of these countries at the multilateral level.  He expressed his appreciation for earlier discussions on the TA Plan that had been organized with the participation of representatives of the CBFA, and noted that the questions raised by Cuba had also been considered in those discussions.  His delegation was pleased to see references in the TA Plan to the Secretariat's intention to design realistic, measurable and achievable objectives, supported by performance indicators and targets. 
He said that his delegation was appreciative of the Secretariat's efforts to work with regional bodies.  More generally on the subject of cooperation, he said that his delegation would welcome more details on how the Secretariat was coordinating and harmonizing the delivery of its technical assistance with other intergovernmental organizations.  The WTO's participation in the Integrated Framework was particularly appreciated.  On the subject of outreach activities, he said that his delegation supported the Secretariat's efforts to reach out to parliamentarians and civil society.  He added that parliamentarians had a fundamental role to play in fostering understanding between citizens and government, and promoting greater transparency and engagement in multilateral institutions and in trade negotiations.  His delegation recommended that consideration be given to enhancing the WTO's partnerships with institutions such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Inter-Parliamentary Forum of the Americas, both of which were engaging in issues relating to trade negotiations.  Finally, he expressed support for the specific inclusion of trade facilitation technical assistance and capacity-building projects.  His delegation believed that this reflected the special recognition of the need for technical assistance and capacity building as outlined in the trade facilitation negotiating modalities. 
&& The representative of Barbados said that his delegation fully endorsed the TA Plan for 2008 and 2009, and supported the biennial approach to planning TA activities.  He welcomed the RTPC that would be held in the Caribbean region in 2008, as well as the two consolidation courses which would be held in 2009.  He expressed appreciation for the flexibility shown in reacting to the needs and priorities of the Caribbean region, which showed that the monitoring and evaluation of TA activities and the follow-up processes were working well.  He was also appreciative of the number of specialized courses that were planned in the Caribbean region, but noted that the geographical areas for planned workshops on the General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS) and the services negotiations had not yet been determined.  In this regard, he indicated the interest of his delegation in having one such workshop in the Caribbean region.  He asked for some clarification on the points made in paragraphs 240 to 242 of the TA plan, in particular through responses to the questions raised by Cuba.  Finally, he expressed the appreciation of his delegation for the support shown by Members for the e-Learning Programme.    
&& The representative of the European Communities expressed appreciation for the large number of technical assistance activities being undertaken by the WTO.  He said that his delegation attached particular importance to the e-Training Programme, which was a good way to reach more beneficiaries at less cost.  In this regard, he wondered whether more training material could be placed on the WTO website.  He highlighted the importance of having measurable objectives and performance indicators, and appreciated the efforts being made by the Secretariat.  He specifically wondered whether the Secretariat had any information on the evaluation of the WTO Reference Centres, particularly in view of the increasing amount of information on the WTO that was now available on the internet.  He said that his delegation also had some concerns with the Geneva-based courses and the RTPCs.  As these courses involved considerable amounts of financial and human resources, he called on beneficiary countries to show engagement by limiting rotation and turnover in Ministries.  With regard to the biennial approach to planning TA activities, he said that it was important to have clarity as to what donors would be expected to contribute and for what purposes.  He suggested that the Secretariat could work towards providing Members with this clarity.  On the financial situation, he announced that the EC had made a contribution of €1 million.  He invited other Members in a position to do so to also make contributions.  Finally, he asked if the Secretariat could provide some information on how any eventual adjustments to the biennial programme would be handled in practice.  
&& The representative of El Salvador said that her delegation supported the TA Plan and the biennial approach.  She expressed her appreciation for a national workshop held in El Salvador in September 2007, and looked forward to further technical assistance activities in 2008.
&& The representative of Lesotho expressed appreciation for the WTO's technical assistance activities, in particular the trainee programmes and internships, which were of great value to LDCs.  She hoped that these initiatives would continue.
&& The representative of the United States said that her delegation was pleased that the preparation of the TA Plan for 2008 and 2009 had evolved through an inter-active process.  This evolution was largely attributable to comments generated during informal consultations.  Her delegation would watch closely the implementation of the biennial plan.  She expressed appreciation for the Secretariat's efforts to improve monitoring and evaluation, and stressed that these efforts – covering both providers and recipients of technical assistance – be a shared endeavour focusing on inputs and results.  Referring to the joint consultation held with representatives of the CTD and the CBFA, she recalled that several Members had indicated at that consultation that they may have difficulty contributing the same amount they were providing to the DDAGTF if part of that amount were transferred to the regular budget.  Furthermore, transferring a part of the amount of the DDAGTF to the regular budget would mean that both donors and recipients would be funding that part of the work from the regular budget.
&& The representative of India said that his delegation welcomed moving to a biennial approach. He said that two regional training workshops had been held in India in 2007.  The first was on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures in April, the second was on trade and environment in September. His delegation looked forward to more opportunities for technical assistance in the future.
&& The representative of Norway said that the TA Plan was a good one.  It built incrementally on experiences from earlier plans, as well as on evaluations of technical assistance activities, in particular the 2006 Strategic Review of the WTO's TRTA activities.  His delegation agreed with the point made by other delegations that measurable criteria to further strengthen the evaluation methodology was welcome.  On the question by Cuba relating to paragraphs 240 to 242 of the TA Plan, he said that the position of his delegation was that TRTA was now an integral part of the WTO's work.  While the WTO should not become a development organization per se, he believed that the work of the WTO in the area of technical assistance was here to stay.  Therefore, Members should consider moving some part of the financing to the regular budget in order to have a better balance between the regular funding of TRTA and voluntary contributions.  While it was appreciated that there were a number of issues that would have to be taken into account, including the size of Members' contributions, his delegation wished to keep this matter open for discussion.
&& The Chairman invited the Secretariat to respond to the questions and comments from Members.
The Deputy Director-General said that a key point was to find a balance between getting more predictability and being able to assure financing for TA on the one hand, while also taking into account the capacity of the Secretariat and the capacity of beneficiary countries.  Efforts would continue to be made in order to find the right balance, for which purpose informal consultations on TA issues would continue to be held.  She said that the approach of the TA Plan – as with previous plans – was to continue to strengthen partnerships with other organizations involved in TRTA, including regional organizations.  This would lead to a sustainable strengthening of capacities, in particular the capacities of regional institutions, which would subsequently allow them to be more closely involved in providing assistance to Members.  With regard to the issue of coordination, she said that the EIF and the Aid for Trade initiative were good examples of efforts being made by the WTO.  She noted that several other organizations were much bigger players than the WTO in the provision of TRTA, and stressed that the role of the WTO was not to extend its own activities, but rather to be a catalyst to ensure better coordination.  On the evaluation of technical assistance activities, she said that the Secretariat was putting in considerable efforts to strengthen its capacity in this area.  She cited e-Training as an example.  She said that through e-Training it was possible to check online whether a certain threshold of knowledge had been attained, which also made it possible to identify in a more efficient manner the needs of participants in TA activities. 
&& The representative of the Budget and Control Section said that the proposal to transfer part of the DDAGTF to the regular budget had been transmitted to the CBFA for Members' consideration.  At present, however, a decision had not yet been taken.  The budget proposal currently under review did not take this into account for the next biennium.  She explained that in the event that a part of Members' voluntary contributions were transferred to the regular budget, this would have an impact on the contributions of all Members – donors and beneficiaries.  The impact would depend on the total amount of increase that this would represent for the regular budget, although at this point in time precise calculations to measure the impact had not been made.  She, however, remarked that the initial impression was that the impact on LDCs and other developing countries would be minimal.  
&& The Chairman proposed that the Committee adopt the TA Plan for 2008 and 2009.
&& The Committee adopted the TA Plan for 2008 and 2009.
