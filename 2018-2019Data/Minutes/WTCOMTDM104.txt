ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA1. && The Chairman said that the draft agenda for the 104th Session of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) was contained in document WTO/AIR/COMTD/12 circulated on 3ÊNovember 2017. 2. && The representative of the United States indicated his delegation's concern with a number of matters relating to the issuance of agendas for CTD meetings and the preparation for these meetings. He explained that, even though the agenda for the present meeting had been issued on 3 November, his delegation had experienced difficulties in accessing it online until 7 November. In order to allow sufficient time for delegations to prepare for meetings, he requested that the fourweek rule for the issuance of the agenda be reinstated, in accordance with the CTD's rules of procedure. After Members were provided with an initial agenda four weeks before a meeting, they should still be able to inscribe items until the time that the agenda for the meeting was circulated, ten days prior to the date of the meeting. He added that, according to the rules of procedure, the documents for a meeting also needed to be circulated when the agenda was circulated. However, in the present case, the Secretariat report on the participation of developing economies in the global trading system, as well as the CTD's draft annual report for 2017, had been issued after the circulation of the agenda. This had not provided Members with enough time to properly consider these documents. His delegation was also concerned that the recent notification by some members of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) Ð contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53 and introduced under "Other Business" at the last meeting Ð did not appear on the agenda for the present meeting. In addition, he made reference to the unofficial room document RD/DEV/155, and indicated that it was unclear where it fitted on the agenda, since it contained a summary of the Chairman's update on both regional trade agreements (RTAs) and preferential trade arrangements (PTAs), and the title of the document did not match any particular agenda item. In closing, he expressed appreciation for the Secretariat's engagement and openness in discussions on these issues with his delegation.   3. && The Chairman suggested that the issues raised by the United States could be taken up under "Other Business". He indicated that he also wished to raise a matter under "Other Business", concerning the work being undertaken by the Secretariat on a publication titled "Mainstreaming Trade in the Sustainable Development Goals".   4. The agenda was adopted as amended.B. OBSERVERS (i)	Request for attendance of ad hoc observers5. && The Chairman recalled that, at previous sessions of the CTD, Members had agreed to invite a number of intergovernmental organizations on an ad hoc meeting-by-meeting basis. These were the Arab Maghreb Union, the Economic Community of Central African States, the Economic Community of West African States, the Economic Cooperation Organisation, the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, the Islamic Development Bank, the African Union, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the South Centre, the Pacific Islands Forum, the United Nations Environment Programme, the West African Economic and Monetary Union, and the World Intellectual Property Organization. These organizations had been invited to the present meeting. He proposed that the same organizations be invited to the next formal meeting of the CTD.6. It was so agreed.(ii)	Further consideration of requests for observer status by the League of Arab States, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting, the Organization Internationale de la Francophonie, the Common Fund for Commodities, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) and the Groupe de la Banque Africaine de DŽveloppement7. && The Chairman said that the positions of delegations were on the record. He indicated that, if there were no changes in positions to extend observer status to any of the applicants, the Committee would take note and revert to the requests at the next meeting. 8. It was so agreed.C. REPORT OF THE 51ST SESSION OF THE JOINT ADVISORY GROUP ON THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE CENTRE UNCTAD/WTO (ITC/AG/(LI)/268)9. && The Chairman said that the report of the 51st Session of the Joint Advisory Group (JAG) on the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), held on 10 July 2017, was contained in ITC document ITC/AG(LI)/268. He invited Ambassador Frances Mary Lisson of Australia, the Chairperson of the 51st Session of the JAG, to introduce the report.10. The Chairperson of the JAG provided an overview of the discussions that had taken place at the JAG meeting. She noted, inter alia, that the ITCÕs role within the Geneva trade hub was recognized by both the WTO Director-General and the Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The Executive Director of the ITC had outlined the continued strong demand for ITC services Ð including with regard to a pipeline of projects valued at over US$ 200 million, and a delivery in 2016 of US$ 85 million Ð while a number of highlevel speakers had shared their thoughts and experiences. With regard to the ITC's Annual Report for 2016, which was presented to the JAG, she said that the ITC had delivered on its targets, with 85% of country-specific interventions channelled to LDCs, Sub-Saharan Africa, landlocked developing countries, small island developing states, small vulnerable economies, and post-conflict and fragile states. The ITC continued to prioritize marginalized segments of society, including through its work on the SheTrades initiative. She went on to say that delegations at the JAG meeting had expressed appreciation for the ITC's focus on priority countries, and for the organization's continued emphasis on promoting inclusive and sustainable trade and economic growth. There was recognition of an improvement in internal coherence and evaluation, and of the ITC's efforts to collaborate with various partners and promote synergies between the private sector and government actors. In terms of thematic focus, delegates highlighted value-chain development, South-South trade and regional integration, export promotion and diversification, reducing non-tariff measures, and trade facilitation. Support was expressed for a number of initiatives, including SheTrades and the Export Potential Map. The ITCÕs work on tourism, ecommerce and e-learning was also appreciated. With regard to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the 2016 edition of the SME Competitiveness Outlook was welcomed. 11. On areas for further improvement, the ITC was asked to strengthen efforts to ensure that deliverables remained tailored to the context of clients. Delegations also requested that work on trade and investment support institutions (TISI) development receive complementary support, in order to provide better services for SMEs. The ITC was invited to continue its efforts to diversify its funding mechanisms. In the second part of the meeting, the JAG was presented with the 2017 Annual Evaluation Synthesis Report, and with the outline of the new Strategic Plan for the 20182021 period. The discussion on the evaluation showcased the findings of the past year, while synthesizing lessons learned and providing recommendations to ITC management for future operations. Overall, the results were positive, and the ITC was found to be on track in terms of its core business and management approach. It was noted that the programmatic approach had been progressively integrated into new project design, and the organization's comparative advantage in supporting SMEs in their efforts to internationalize was confirmed. With regard to the Strategic Plan, the discussion centred on ensuring that the new strategy linked the ITCÕs interventions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focused on customized approaches to the specific trade and development needs of clients, and prioritized results and impact. Delegations were invited to further contribute to the consultative process. In closing, she listed a number of events taking place during the WTO's Eleventh Ministerial Conference (MC11) in which the ITC would participate. These included the Trade and Sustainable Development Symposium, the launching of both a trade helpdesk for SMEs and a cotton portal, and an event concerning SheTrades in Argentina and the promotion of an inclusive trade agenda. The ITC would also support a declaration on gender and trade.12. && The representative of Japan expressed appreciation for the ITCÕs efforts to realize sustainable economic growth through inclusive trade. She commended the organization for its active and tangible work on the ground, and welcomed the positive results achieved. Her delegation looked forward to further collaboration with the ITC.   13. && The representative of the European Union appreciated the ITC's cooperation with her delegation, and congratulated the organization on its recent performance. She noted with satisfaction the increasing focus of assistance to LDCs and other countries most in need, as well as the ITC's work in such areas as women's economic empowerment.14. && The Committee took note of the report of the 51st Session of the JAG and forwarded it to the General Council for adoption.  D. TECHNICAL COOPERATION AND TRAINING-	Annual Performance Report on Technical Assistance and Training 2016 (WT/COMTD/W/225)15. && The Chairman said that the Annual Performance Report on Technical Assistance and Training 2016 was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/225. He invited a representative of the Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation (ITTC) to introduce the report.  16. && The representative of the ITTC said that the report was structured around three principal sections. There was firstly a section on the main developments in technical assistance (TA) in 2016 compared to the previous year. Another section addressed the implementation of the TA Plan and the main features of the TA provided in 2016, while a third section looked at the evaluation of performance in 2016. As part of his summary of the main developments in 2016, he observed that, while the volume of activities and related expenses remained stable, the Secretariat had been obliged to tap into its financial reserves, in light of a decrease in resources. He indicated that progress continued towards the full implementation of a TA management system based on results, and pointed to an improvement in the substantive content of the TA offer, including through a number of new courses. Turning to the implementation of the Biennial Technical Assistance and Training Plan (TA Plan) for the 2016-2017 period, he informed the Committee that 274 activities were delivered in 2016, and the Secretariat was also involved in 40 other activities. A total of 18,600 participants were trained, representing an increase of 25% compared to 2015. About 43% of the participants were women. As in previous years, priority continued to be given to Africa and the least developed countries (LDCs). Half of the TA provided had a general scope, while the specific subjects most in demand were sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, technical barriers to trade (TBT), market access for goods and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS). In terms of languages, the most significant evolution was the increase in the proportion of activities offered with interpretation in at least one other language. Finally, he provided an overview of the section concerning the evaluation of performance Ð which he noted was positive overall, and was focused on the four Key Results identified in the TA Plan. The Committee was informed that Key Result 1 was the most successful, with 71% of its targets met. This was followed by Key Result 2 at 50%, Key Result 4 at 39%, and Key Result 3 at 25%.   17. && The representative of India emphasized the importance of TA for developing countries. He commended the Secretariat for having maintained the volume of TA activities in 2016, and for having tailored the TA activities to beneficiariesÕ priorities. He also welcomed the focused approach adopted by the Secretariat in the TA activities and hoped that this approach would continue in the future.18.  && The representative of Sri Lanka welcomed the success of the TA activities in 2016. He highlighted the importance of the WTO's TA for beneficiary countries, and invited the Secretariat to provide technical support to Sri Lanka for the development of a trade remedy system. He noted with interest the significant rise in the number of participants in online courses, as well as the success of the intermediate trade policy courses. He also stressed the importance of the internship programmes Ð particularly for small missions like his own, which had a limited number of officials covering WTO matters.   19. && The representative of Egypt welcomed the ITTC's efforts in the context of decreasing TA resources. He recognized the importance of TA activities in enhancing the capacity of developing countries, and encouraged the ITTC to continue its work in this regard.20. && The representative of China welcomed the TA performance in 2016, while also noting the decrease in TA resources. She pointed to the significant rise in the number of participants in TA activities, and appreciated the continued efforts of the ITTC to address Members' needs and concerns. She also expressed China's support for the WTO's TA activities and for the new TA Plan for the 2018-2019 period.      21. && The Committee took note of the Annual Performance Report on Technical Assistance and Training for 2016, and of all interventions.- Biennial Technical Assistance and Training 2018-19 (WT/COMTD/W/227/Rev.1)22. && The Chairman said that the TA Plan for the 2018-2019 period was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/227/Rev.1. The ITTC had prepared the Plan in full consultation with Members. Three preparatory documents were used during the consultation process. The first, which was an option paper on a feasibility study for a fee-paying training scheme, was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/226. The second paper, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/228, was an assessment by the Secretariat of the Advanced Trade Policy Course (ATPC). The third preparatory document, which was an option paper on enhancing the language mix in TA activities, was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/229. It was his understanding that the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (CBFA) would consider the financing of the Plan at its meeting on 16 November 2017. He invited a representative of the ITTC to introduce the Plan.23. && The representative of the ITTC recalled several informal meetings with Members that had been held in the course of 2017 to discuss the preparation of the TA Plan. He noted that the recent external evaluation of the WTO's TA, as well as the management response to the evaluation Ð which had been considered at the 101st Session of the CTD Ð had provided key inputs into the preparation of the Plan. A first version of the Plan had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/227 and was discussed with Members. Based on Members' comments, the Secretariat had circulated a revision of the Plan, as contained in document WT/COMTD/W/227/Rev.1. This document was discussed at the CBFA meeting of 6 November, and was up for consideration at the present meeting. He said that the Plan aimed to reach its objectives by identifying four Key Results. In the context of the Plan, the Secretariat intended to continue promoting TA activities that focused on the implementation of WTO Agreements, while also continuing to review and refine its internal results-based management tools and related processes, and applying more comprehensively the Progressive Learning Strategy. The Secretariat was additionally aiming to make further improvements to its e-learning programme, its pedagogical methods, and its use of value-adding partnerships and Trade Policy Review follow-ups. The logframe had also been revisited to improve the relevance of the performance indicators chosen. He added that the Secretariat was seeking to carry out the actions outlined in its response to the external evaluation Ð including by looking into the link between TA and gender issues, the availability of course offerings in all three languages, and revising the ATPC Ð and would continue to engage with Members on issues raised in the evaluation. The Secretariat also wished to address the constraints arising from the limited availability of suitable training rooms in the WTO campus. In closing, he indicated that the Plan had been prepared on the assumption that TA resources would be stable during the next biennium, thereby allowing approximately the same level of TA activity to be maintained as in previous years. 24. && The representative of the European Union emphasized the importance of the WTO's TA in enabling developing countries and LDCs to participate effectively in the multilateral trading system (MTS). She also welcomed the efforts by the Secretariat and beneficiaries to enhance the efficiency and impact of TA activities, and expressed her hope that TA activities in the next biennium would target the main goals and the main beneficiaries, while remaining within the planned budget.25. && The representative of Singapore recalled two gender-relevant recommendations which had been put forward by the external evaluators. The first, which was Recommendation 11, was to continue to monitor and report on the participation of women and men with a view to addressing remaining gender imbalances of participation in WTO TA. The second Ð Recommendation 19 Ð was to take every opportunity to integrate issues of gender equality and the empowerment of women into TA programmes and training material in the context of emerging initiatives on social and poverty implications of trade, including the SDGs. Her delegation understood and supported the need to facilitate the participation of women in TA activities, and therefore encouraged the Secretariat to continue to make efforts to ensure that this goal was achieved. In this regard, she expressed her support for Recommendation 11. With regard to Recommendation 19, she noted from section 3.3.1 of the TA Plan Ð which concerned TA and gender issues Ð that the Secretariat was proposing to introduce modules on trade and gender, with a view to raising awareness and enhancing the aptitude of policymakers to incorporate gender considerations in their trade policy development or negotiations. In this regard, she believed that some caution needed to be exercised. She explained that gender did not feature in the WTO Agreements, and there was presently no consensus or full understanding of the role of gender vis-ˆ-vis the making of trade rules. The proposed modules could therefore influence substantive discussions on the matter, which were still in their nascent stages. In this light, her delegation wished to know more about the elements that would be included in the proposed modules in the context of e-learning, the APTCs and the Regional Trade Policy Courses (RTPCs). She also sought information on how the proposed modules would tie in with the TA mandate, and how the content would be separated from any potential substantive discussions at the WTO on the subject.26. && The representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believed that the TA Plan allowed for the implementation of TA activities in a transparent and predictable manner. He recognized the crucial role of the WTO's TA activities in enhancing Members' capacities, and called on the Secretariat to continue its efforts to improve the efficiency of the TA programmes, based on lessons learned and on the priorities identified by beneficiaries.27. && The representative of Norway appreciated that the TA Plan took into account several issues raised by his delegation, including with regard to the inclusion of a suitable results framework. His delegation believed that priority should be accorded to the utilization of Trade Policy Reviews (TPRs) as a source for enhanced assistance. At the same time, in view of the financial situation, lower priority should be given to exploring opportunities for external parties to participate in learning programmes. He explained that it could be problematic to fund activities involving external parties with allocations for development cooperation. 28. && The representative of Swaziland expressed appreciation to the ITTC for the TA delivered, as well as to donors for their support.29.  && The representative of the United States recognized the results achieved by the ITTC in a challenging financial environment. He noted the improvements brought to the TA programmes, such as the development of new courses and the use of e-learning, and highlighted the effectiveness of e-learning as a means of delivering training. He also indicated that his delegation had a similar view to that expressed by Singapore on the trade and gender modules, and the need to exercise caution in areas where consensus had not been reached in the WTO. In this regard, he wished to know more about the elements of the proposed modules. 30. && The representative of Cambodia, on behalf of the LDC Group, expressed appreciation for the WTO's TA activities and for the new TA Plan. He indicated the Group's commitment to working closely with the ITTC and development partners to further enhance the efficiency of TA activities.31.  && The representative of India noted that the consultations undertaken by the Secretariat with Members in order to reflect their priorities in the new TA Plan represented a bottom-up approach. He believed that such an approach would contribute to helping Members to implement existing WTO Agreements and make use of existing benefits relating to these agreements.32. && The representative of Kenya highlighted the benefits of the WTO's TA activities. He welcomed the new TA Plan and hoped that his country would be able to take advantage of the training and capacity-building opportunities offered by the WTO. In closing, he thanked the Secretariat and the donors for their efforts.  33. The Director of the ITTC said that the way the section on TA and gender issues had been drafted in the TA Plan, reflected an appreciation of the need to exercise caution in this area of work. The Secretariat would pilot a module on trade and gender, and would revert to Members with concrete suggestions and findings, while also seeking further guidance. She additionally welcomed the positive comments by Members, and their support for the WTO's TA activities.  34. && The Committee adopted the Biennial Technical Assistance and Training Plan for 2018-19.E. TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT Ð WORK IN THE COMMITTEE ON THE BASIS OF THE CHAIRMAN'S CONCLUDING STATEMENT FROM THE EIGHTH MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE (WT/MIN(11)/11)35. && The Chairman recalled that, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference (MC8), Ministers had, interÊalia, reaffirmed the positive link between trade and development and called for focused work in the CTD. Ministers had called on Members to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. In this regard, there were two proposals for consideration at the present meeting. The first proposal Ð contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 and submitted by Barbados, Belize, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India and the African Group Ð was for the CTD to report on the development-related work taking place in other WTO bodies. The second proposal under consideration Ð submitted by China, Cuba, Ecuador, India and the African Group Ð was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192. Although there were three proposals in this document, only one remained outstanding. The remaining proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192 was for the CTD to make a recommendation for parties to RTAs to submit their notification and information requirements jointly. 36. He went on to say that the two documents had been appearing on the CTD's agenda for quite some time. Despite the informal consultations held by past CTD Chairs, no substantive progress had been made. With regard to document WT/COMTD/W/208, he recalled that, at the last CTD meeting, a number of proponents had reiterated their position, while some other Members had reminded the Committee of their concerns with the proposal, and had called for the circulation of a revised proposal. As for document WT/COMTD/W/192, he recalled that the proponents had indicated at the last meeting their willingness to consider the circulation of a new document, which would contain only the remaining proposal. He also informed the Committee that he had convened an informal consultation with the proponents on 2 October 2017, in order to ascertain progress with respect to the circulation of the new document. The delegations that attended had indicated that the proponents would still need time to discuss the matter amongst themselves in order to determine a way forward. The same message was conveyed when the matter was discussed at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting held on 6 November. He hoped that some progress could be reported at the present meeting.-	Committee on Trade and Development Mandate: Focal Point for Consideration and Coordination of Work on Development in the WTO Ð Proposal from Barbados, Belize, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, and the African Group (WT/COMTD/W/208)-	Operationalization of the CTD's Mandate: a Proposal to Deliver Outcomes based on the MC8 Mandate Ð Proposal from China, Cuba, Ecuador, India and the African Group (WT/COMTD/W/192)1   37. && The representative of India recalled the CTD's mandate from MC8, as well as elements of the terms of reference (TORs) of the CTD, as contained in document WT/L/46.  He explained that the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 was a simple paraphrasing of the CTD's TORs, which specified that the CTD served as a focal point for consideration and coordination of development work in the WTO. In addition, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the TORs indicated that the CTD was to report to the General Council for appropriate action on matters relating to the review of the application of special provisions in favour of developing Members and LDCs, as well as in the context of any questions regarding their use or application. He believed that it was appropriate for the CTD to report regularly on the development-related work taking place in other WTO bodies, while providing the necessary recommendations to the General Council on achieving better coordination within the WTO on development issues. He also indicated that, while he did not understand the concerns expressed by some Members on the overarching mandate given to the CTD in the proposal, his delegation was willing to discuss the matter with these Members in a small-group setting. In concluding his intervention on this proposal, he requested that the subitem concerning document WT/COMTD/W/208 be maintained on the CTD's agenda.38. He went on to say that he also wished to provide an update on the remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192. With regard to this proposal, he said that the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs (RTA TM) provided for several notifications to be carried out by Members parties to RTAs. In order to avoid misunderstandings and to help ensure a timely consideration of RTAs, and hence the smooth operation of the TM, it was important for the parties to submit their notification and information requirements jointly. He recalled that, at the last CTD meeting, the Committee was informed that the proponents were holding consultations in order to submit a revised document containing only the remaining proposal. Progress was being made in this regard. He also clarified that there would not be any changes to the remaining proposal itself. Finally, he reiterated the openness of the proponents to engage in informal consultations with interested Members in order to reach consensus on this issue. He requested that the sub-tem relating to document WT/COMTD/W/192 remain on the CTD's agenda.  39. && The representative of Egypt, on behalf of the African Group, supported the intervention by India, and expressed appreciation to the Chairman for the informal consultations that had been held on this issue. He indicated that the proponents were still discussing amongst themselves how to move forward on the remaining proposals contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/192 and WT/COMTD/W/208, and requested that the two submissions remain on the CTD's agenda. 40.  && The representative of China expressed support for the interventions by India and Egypt, and welcomed the informal consultations that were held by the Chairman. She indicated that the issues contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/208 and WT/COMTD/W/192 were of relevance for developing countries and the MTS. With respect to the proposal in WT/COMTD/W/208, she explained that the CTD was the focal point for consideration and coordination of development issues in the WTO, and that the proponents were simply aiming to fulfil Ministers' instructions to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD. It was not only a matter of ensuring the good functioning of the CTD, but also ensuring the effectiveness of the political guidance from MC8. Turning to the remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192, she expressed support for the initiative to circulate a revised document. She said that the dual notification of RTAs remained an important issue, and Members needed to give attention to the proposal. The communication from China, Egypt and India, circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/175, further elaborated on the systemic and specific issues arising from dual notifications, with a view to finding an appropriate solution.41. && The representative of the European Union indicated that her delegation's position on the remaining proposals contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/208 and WT/COMTD/W/192 remained the same as had been outlined in past CTD meetings. She welcomed the willingness of the proponents to engage in informal consultations.42. && The representative of the United States appreciated the Chairman's efforts to help find a way forward on the remaining proposals. He pointed out that several years had passed since the proposals had been submitted, which was sufficient time for other Members to have fully considered them. Furthermore the proponents had not taken any initiative to advance their ideas. In this light, he believed that it was time for the proponents to practice what they had been pointing to in other WTO bodies, either by revising their proposals or by removing the items relating to these two documents from the CTD's agenda. Turning specifically to the remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192, he said that the United States had repeatedly shared the view that the proposal suggested a diminishing of Members' substantive rights and obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In his delegation's view, there was no prospect for consensus on this matter in either the CTD or the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA). The only outcome from the proposal would be to provide one Member with the right to prevent others from availing of an exception to the GATT under the Enabling Clause, or from complying with the notification obligations under the Enabling Clause. He believed that this would be prejudicial to that Member in the face of any dispute settlement proceedings regarding a particular agreement. The proponents had so far failed to address this concern, and his delegation looked forward to seeing how these issues would be reconciled.43. && The representative of Japan said that she wished to echo the comments made by the European Union and the United States. Her delegation once again called for the active and serious engagement of the proponents if they wished to make progress on the proposals.44. && The Chairman encouraged continued engagement among Members in order to try and make progress, and indicated his willingness to work with delegations in this regard. He recalled that the practice in the CTD was to maintain an item on the agenda if any Member so requested. Therefore, as there were such requests, the sub-items relating to the two proposals would be maintained on the CTD's agenda.45. && The Committee took note of all interventions.F. NOTIFICATIONS UNDER THE ENABLING CLAUSE46. && The Chairman said that he wished to provide Members with a brief update on RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. He indicated that for Egypt's accession to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the parties had been requested to provide the data for the preparation of the factual presentation by 6 June 2017. The Secretariat had thus far received data from Egypt, Seychelles, and Swaziland. With regard to the agreement between the Dominican Republic and Panama, the Secretariat had received data and had started preparing the factual presentation. Concerning Afghanistan's accession to the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), the Secretariat had still not received the data from the parties, which had been requested by 22 December 2016. The Secretariat had received data only from Bangladesh for the original SAFTA notification. Turning to the Arab Mediterranean Free Trade Agreement (Agadir Agreement) between Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, he said that a draft factual presentation had been sent on 11 April 2017, without the tariff or trade information from Tunisia. Comments, which were requested by 23 May 2017, had been received from Egypt, Jordan and Morocco. Data had also been received from Tunisia, but the negative lists of Tunisia and Egypt were yet to be sent. As for the agreement between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Singapore, he indicated that a draft factual presentation had been sent to the parties. However, the Secretariat was still waiting to receive complete data from the GCC parties. Data had been received from Singapore, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, and the Secretariat was presently seeking further clarification from Bahrain and Kuwait. Data on preferential tariffs and exceptions to mostfavoured-nation (MFN) rates had also not been received from the other GCC parties.47. Turning to the accession of Rwanda and Burundi to the East African Community, he said that the Secretariat was awaiting comments on the draft factual presentation, which had been requested by 16 June 2014. For a number of other RTAs Ð namely, RTAs between India and Nepal, India and Afghanistan, India and Bhutan, and Cuba and El Salvador Ð no data had been submitted by the parties. He urged all the parties to these agreements to provide the data as soon as possible. He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the CRTA, a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the agreement had been ratified by all the parties. The parties to PICTA were urged to inform the Secretariat as soon as all ratifications were completed. He also informed the Committee of two newer notifications. The first concerned the India-Thailand agreement, which had been notified on 18 June 2017 in document WT/COMTD/N/54. The parties to this agreement had been requested to submit the required data by 10 November 2017, but so far no data had been received. The second concerned the agreement between MERCOSUR and the Southern African Customs Union, which had been notified on 19 July 2017 in document WT/COMTD/N/55. The parties had been requested to submit the required data by 11ÊDecemberÊ2017.48. He continued by noting that, on 2 October 2017, he had convened an informal consultation with Members that had notified RTAs, as well as PTAs, which were to be considered in Dedicated Sessions of the CTD, but had yet to submit the full set of data or information to the Secretariat. Representatives from the Secretariat had attended this meeting to clarify the data and information requirements, and to answer any questions. He expressed hope that this consultation had been useful, and would help in expediting the submission of the required data and information. Finally, with regard to LAIA, he recalled that a notification on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay Ð members of LAIA Ð circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/53, was introduced under ÒOther BusinessÓ at the last CTD meeting. Members had been informed that this document contained 16 individual notifications Ð one for each of the agreements concluded under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo over the period 1 January 2016 Ð 31 December 2016. According to the document, these notifications had been submitted pursuant to the individual obligation of WTO Members to notify instruments concluded under paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause, and in compliance with sections D to G of the RTA TM, without prejudice to notifications submitted individually by LAIA members to the CTD or the CRTA. He added that issues relating to the LAIA agreements had been discussed previously in the CTD and in the CRTA. The European Union had also recently circulated additional questions which had been considered at the CRTA meeting of 9ÊNovember 2017. He also noted that the CRTA Secretariat had been in touch with LAIA countries and had sought clarification on certain aspects of the LAIA agreements that had been notified.49. && The representative of the United States expressed appreciation for the Chairman's efforts to report regularly to the Committee on progress in the implementation of the RTA TM. He believed that discussion in the CTD on this matter would be enhanced by a better reflection on the agenda of the content and purpose of the Chairman's report. He explained that the report made reference to the various steps involved in the implementation of the RTA TM, and pointed to the obligations that some Members had not yet met. Noting that the Committee had a role in addressing these issues, he requested the Chairman to henceforth provide a detailed agenda item that would more accurately reflect the report provided, as was done in the CRTA. This would allow Members to have a better preview of what was expected from them. He also urged the parties to the RTAs, referred to by the Chairman in his report to provide the required data as soon as possible, so as to allow the preparation of factual presentations on these RTAs. He went on to say that he was surprised that notifications of RTAs under the Enabling Clause were not listed under the present agenda item. In this regard, he requested that the CTD follow the practice in other WTO bodies, by ensuring that each notification submitted to the Committee be reflected on the agenda for the first meeting after the submission was made. This would allow Members to take note of the submission and ask questions if appropriate. He emphasized the importance of respecting the timelines set out in the RTA TM, since waiting for sporadic Dedicated Sessions of the CTD to include the items concerning these notifications on the agenda was not consistent with the transparency framework of the Mechanism. He also noted more generally that his delegation had observed a wide divergence in practice between the CTD and the CRTA, and the relevant Secretariat staff, in the implementation of the RTA TM. He suggested that the CTD Chairman, along with the CRTA Chairman and relevant Secretariat staff, undertake internal consultations to compare the policies and practices relating to the implementation of the RTA TM. His delegation would follow up on this matter with the intention of ensuring that the Mechanism was implemented consistently across the two bodies.50. He then turned to the notification circulated by a number of LAIA countries, contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53. He explained that his delegation had some comments on the notification, and had expected it to be listed under the present agenda item. While appreciating the notification, his delegation wished to raise some initial questions on procedural and substantive elements, and revert to the matter as a formal agenda item at the next meeting. He went on to say that he did not fully understand the intention of the LAIA countries that had submitted this notification. In particular, he wished to better understand what had been notified and why these Members had chosen this manner of notification. The cover note of the document contained language which his delegation believed was internally contradictory, and the information provided in the notification template was different from what was provided in the cover note. Furthermore, his delegation was confused by the issuance of one notification with one document symbol for what had been explained in the cover note as 16 individual notifications, but which was in fact five separate agreements with a variety of LAIA countries, and not the same Members for each notification. His delegation looked forward to discussing these concerns in greater detail Ð given that this notification was different from any notification his delegation was familiar with, and that a consolidation in this manner seemed to undermine the transparency goals at the heart of the notification itself. 51. With regard to the issue of what was being notified, he sought clarity on whether the notification represented entire agreements, or parts of agreements. He also wished to know whether the intent was the same for all the agreements referred to in the document, or if the intent differed among the five separate agreements. With regard to the indication by the notifying Members at the last CTD meeting that the notification conformed to the common notification format contained in document WT/COMTD/63, he shared his delegation's view that the notification template was for individual agreements, and not for five unrelated agreements in one document. Noting that the practice in the CRTA on the numbering and tracking of notifications had greatly improved the transparency for Members, he recommended that the CTD follow this practice, since Enabling Clause notifications seemed to be given random numbers Ð which made more difficult the tracking of subsequent changes, modifications, accessions, and the final implementation reports. He said that he was raising these issues at the present time, in light of his understanding that LAIA members had sought assistance from Secretariat staff in preparing the notification. His delegation had also met with Secretariat staff in an attempt to get answers to its questions, but had been unable to. He believed that this indicated a lack of clarity that the Committee needed to address. In closing, he expressed appreciation for the effort by LAIA members to pursue the notification of their instruments, but also indicated that the progress made through dialogue on this issue over the years could be stalled if the Committee continued to be confronted with notifications that were confusing or unclear. Some of his delegation's concerns related to the notifying Members' intent, while other concerns were with respect to an inconsistent handling of RTA notifications across WTO bodies.52. && The representative of the European Union thanked the Chairman for his update. She said that her delegation was presently considering the notification concerning the MERCOSUR-SACU agreement, and might have questions on it at a later date. With regard to LAIA, she recalled the European Union's questions that were circulated in the CRTA in document WT/REG/W/109, as well as the LAIA replies contained in document WT/COMTD/W/224. The European Union had also submitted follow-up questions in document WT/REG/W/124. She believed that the notification contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53 was a positive step in the right direction, as it facilitated the European Union's understanding of the wide network of LAIA agreements. Notwithstanding this, the European Union had some questions on the format and content of the notification, which was different from standard notifications. She noted that the practice in the CRTA was for an individual number to be assigned to each notified RTA. This allowed Members to track subsequent changes to the RTA, while linking these changes to the underlying agreement Ð or what the European Union referred to as the "mother agreement". In light of this, the European Union did not know how to interpret the notification by the LAIA countries, and sought clarification on the extent to which the document contained references to subsequent changes to an underlying RTA. She explained that her delegation's follow-up questions circulated in the CRTA aimed, among other things, to identify LAIA members' underlying RTAs, and to determine whether these RTAs had been notified. She added that the European Union was open to discuss the LAIA replies to these follow-up questions at a joint dedicated technical session of the CTD and CRTA. This would address the concern of the LAIA members that wished to discuss the matter in the CTD.53. && The representative of Uruguay recalled that her delegation had submitted a notification Ð circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/53 Ð on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay. The document, which had been introduced under "Other Business" at the last meeting, contained 16 individual notifications that corresponded to each of the agreements concluded under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo for the period covering 1 January 2016 Ð 31ÊDecember 2016. These notifications were submitted under the individual obligations of WTO Members to notify the instruments concluded under paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause and in compliance with sections D to G of the RTA TM, without prejudice to notifications submitted individually by LAIA member states to the CTD or the CRTA. She added that LAIA members were committed to the transparency required by the RTA TM for the notification of agreements. This was why LAIA members did not have any problem with the inclusion of the LAIA notification on the CTD agenda. She thanked the European Union and the United States for their comments on the notification, and requested that they be provided in writing to LAIA members. She also indicated that the LAIA members were presently considering the European Union's follow-up questions circulated in the CRTA.54. && The representative of Brazil supported the observations by Uruguay concerning LAIA members' commitment to transparency. He said that the comments by the European Union and the United States would be duly relayed to his capital. He added that Brazil's commitment to transparency was embodied in the circulation of the notification contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53, which was submitted using the standard format of notification. In doing so, LAIA countries aimed to address some of the concerns raised by other Members on the manner in which the LAIA agreements were being notified to the CTD. He expressed his delegation's readiness to respond to specific questions on the agreements included in the notification, as provided for in paragraphs 16 and 18 of the RTA TM. With regard to the procedural issues raised by the United States, he indicated that the LAIA members were willing to follow the Committee's procedures.55. && The representative of Egypt indicated that he wished to make an intervention on the Agadir Agreement. He said that Egypt had recently provided the Secretariat with the negative list requested, and was currently working with the Secretariat on the transposition of this list from Harmonized System (HS) 92 to HS 07.56. && The representative of Argentina expressed support for the comments by Uruguay and Brazil concerning LAIA members' commitment to transparency. He indicated the readiness of his delegation to engage in any dialogue on the notification contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53.57. && The representative of Chile emphasized the commitment to transparency of the LAIA members. He expressed his delegation's willingness to engage in dialogue on the notification contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53, and to provide all relevant information.  58. && && The Chairman encouraged Members to work together, with a view to finding a way forward on issues relating to the LAIA agreements. He also indicated that he had taken note of the procedural suggestions by the US.         59. && The Committee took note of the Chairman's update, and of all interventions.60. Turning to the listed sub-items under the present agenda item, the Chairman recalled that the issues surrounding the three RTAs notified under both GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause had been discussed at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting that he had convened on 6ÊNovember 2017. While he had encouraged Members to use the opportunity to explore possible ways forward, he had noted that positions still remained the same. He had nevertheless encouraged continued engagement among Members in order to find a way forward.-	Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Notification of Customs Union Ð Communication from China, Egypt and India (WT/COMTD/W/175)-	Notification of the Agreement on Trade in Goods between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Korea-	Notification of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement between India and Korea (Goods)261. && The representative of India indicated that his intervention related to the three sub-items under the present agenda item. He noted that the systemic concerns that were raised by China, Egypt and India over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT ArticleÊXXIV were pertinent even now, but they remained unaddressed. Some Members had expressed the view that the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 were outside the scope of the CTD, and needed to be discussed in the Negotiating Group on Rules. The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. Pointing to the terms of reference of the CTD contained in document WT/L/46, he noted that the CTD was designated to serve as a focal point for consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO and its relationship to development-related activities in other multilateral agencies. He added that the Committee could consult with other WTO bodies in addressing the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175. This was in keeping with paragraph 3 of the CTD's TORs, which entrusted the Committee to review periodically, in consultation as appropriate with the relevant bodies of the WTO, the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular LDC Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. 62. He went on to outline some of the issues raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 which he believed needed to be addressed. He indicated firstly that Members needed to consider the legal and procedural implications of notifying the GCC Customs Union on the basis of the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV, without either notification being withdrawn. Members also needed to consider the role of the CTD and the CRTA in considering an RTA that was notified under both provisions. He additionally pointed to the question of how the CTD should deal in the future with RTAs between developing Members that were notified under the Enabling Clause, insofar as this related to the fulfilment of paragraphs 1 and 4 of the CTD's TORs. There was also the issue of whether a Member could notify an RTA under a specific legal provision unilaterally Ð without the consent of the other parties to the RTA Ð and whether a notification could be made on behalf of all the parties to the RTA under another legal provision. Furthermore, the implications arising from Members retaining a notification under the Enabling Clause Ð but not conducting a factual consideration of the RTA in the CTD Ð needed to be addressed, as did the question of how this would figure specifically in the case of the GCC Customs Union, where a factual review had been scheduled. In concluding, he indicated that the three sub-items under the present agenda item should remain on the CTD's agenda until the systemic and specific concerns arising from "dually notified" RTAs were addressed.63. && The representative of the European Union said that it was important to clarify the legal and procedural questions arising from an agreement being notified by parties under different legal provisions. She felt that a pragmatic solution to the notifications in question was needed, and indicated that any substantive discussion on the matter should take place in the framework of the implementation of Paragraph 28 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration. In addition, she emphasized the importance of making a distinction between the different notifications. With regard to the GCC Customs Union notification, she repeated the European Union's position conveyed at previous CTD meetings that a customs union could not be notified under the Enabling Clause. In that respect, she urged the GCC parties to withdraw their notification under the Enabling Clause. As for the notifications of the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements, she called on the parties to these agreements to make efforts to find a pragmatic solution.64. && The representative of the United States said that he largely agreed with the comments by the European Union. He additionally pointed out that the GCC parties' notification under GATT Article XXIV was presently going through a process in the CRTA. The parties had submitted data to the Secretariat and a factual presentation had been drafted for circulation in the CRTA. The Secretariat was currently waiting for comments from the parties. In this respect, he questioned the need to discuss the matter in the CTD. With regard to document WT/COMTD/W/175, he believed that the issue raised of how to proceed with the consideration of RTAs notified under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV was an interesting one. However, he also noted that neither India nor ASEAN members had fulfilled their obligations by providing the data necessary for the preparation of the factual presentations on the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements. Once the factual presentations were prepared, Members could discuss how to move forward with the consideration of these agreements. The intention of his delegation was to ask each of the parties to these agreements that had not submitted the data to provide information on the status of data submission. He stressed that it would only be possible to discuss the question of the venue for the consideration of these agreements after the parties had submitted the required data.      65. && The representative of Korea said that he wished to repeat the points made by his delegation at the informal, open-ended meeting held on 6 November. He noted that issues relating to dual notifications of RTAs had appeared on the CTD's agenda for several years, and that his delegation had engaged in discussions with interested Members, and with CTD Chairs, with a view to resolving the matter. He recalled that Korea had duly notified its RTAs Ð and in particular the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements Ð in accordance with GATT Article XXIV and GATS Article V, and in compliance with the RTA TM. He believed that a Member had a right to decide under which provisions it would notify the RTAs it had concluded. It was also possible that the parties to an RTA would agree upon this during their negotiations or notification preparation. Furthermore, while the Enabling Clause was designed to allow developing Members to accord differential and more favourable treatment to each other, he was unsure whether the ASEANKorea and India-Korea agreements fell into this category. With regard to RTA notifications, he indicated that there were some systemic issues listed in document WT/COMTD/W/175 and other submissions, and emphasized the need to find an appropriate approach to address the matter. In this regard, he expressed some doubt on the possibility of a separate consideration in the CRTA and in the CTD, and shared his view that all RTAs should be considered in a comprehensive way in the same body, irrespective of whether they covered trade in goods or trade in services. He also pointed to the mandate in Paragraph 28 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration, and indicated that the timing was right to discuss RTA notification issues. He suggested that the items concerning dual notifications be removed from the CTD's agenda, at least during the discussions on the transformation of the current provisional RTA TM into a permanent mechanism.      66. && The Committee took note of all interventions.  G. WORK PROGRAMME ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE-	E-commerce Elements for MC11 Ð Communication from China (JOB/GC/142, JOB/CTG/9, JOB/SERV/271, JOB/DEV/49) 	67. && The Chairman recalled that, at earlier meetings of the CTD in 2017, the Committee had considered a number of communications relating to the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. At the present meeting, a communication from China, contained in document JOB/DEV/49, was listed on the agenda. He invited China to introduce the communication.  68. && The representative of China said that her delegation had introduced an earlier communication contained in document JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1 Ð titled "Aiming at the 11th Ministerial Conference", and co-sponsored with Pakistan Ð in a number of WTO bodies. In this context, and in order to ensure the inclusiveness of the MTS, China had emphasized that e-commerce discussions in the WTO should be based on the mandate of the 1998 Work Programme on Electronic Commerce, and should have the development dimension at its core. China had also proactively shared with Members its experience on measures taken to develop e-commerce in order to facilitate progress in this area at MC11. Based on Members' inputs and concerns raised in previous discussions, China had submitted the communication contained in document JOB/DEV/49, titled "E-commerce elements for MC11". This newer communication highlighted elements of interest to most Members. Her delegation hoped that the elements of this communication would form part of the MC11 outcome on e-commerce, and could serve as building blocks for future work. She proposed that, in light of the cross-cutting nature of e-commerce, these elements could be explored in a dedicated session of the General Council, or in a body to be agreed upon by all Members. She hoped that positive consideration would be given to some specific elements of this communication Ð including the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions, the facilitation of cross-border e-commerce, transparency, and development and cooperation. 69. She indicated that she wished to elaborate further on the elements of the communication relating to development and cooperation. In this regard, she said that the experience of several Members had shown that e-commerce was conducive to development Ð including by helping farmers and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in remote areas to better integrate into domestic and international trade markets. She added that discussions on ecommerce at the WTO needed to take into account the specific needs of developing Members and LDCs, and enhance their ability to benefit from e-commerce, including through the principle of special and differential treatment. Given the complexity of e-commerce issues and the different development levels of Members, she suggested that Members could cooperate on areas of common interest, and jointly explore how to make progress on e-commerce issues at MC11 and beyond, so as to allow the MTS to maintain its relevance in this area. In closing, she noted that China had also introduced this communication at the November 2017 meeting of the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG), and indicated her delegation's willingness to further discuss the issues raised in the communication with interested Members.  70.  && The representative of the European Union indicated that she wished to briefly present a communication contained in document JOB/GC/140 and its revisions, which her delegation had cosponsored with a number of other Members. The communication proposed the establishment of a Working Party on E-Commerce to address cross-cutting issues. The Working Party would conduct preparations for, and carry out negotiations on, the trade-related aspects of e-commerce on the basis of proposals by Members. The draft ministerial decision contained in the communication was neutral with respect to substance, and it would be up to Members to bring their issue of interests with respect to any trade-related aspects of e-commerce. This approach would ensure that any matter which was important to a Member, or a group of Members, could be discussed and negotiated. The co-sponsors believed that this was a constructive way to proceed, which took into account the sensitivities that existed across the Membership, and built upon the debate in the previous two years. The suggestion was not to adopt a pre-set agenda, but rather to allow Members to collectively build a negotiating agenda.71. && The representative of Chinese Taipei said that he wished to introduce two communications that his delegation had recently circulated in the CTD in documents JOB/DEV/45 and JOB/DEV/46. He said that he would not repeat the full content of the communications, as they had already been presented in the Council for Trade in Services (CTS) meeting in October, and the CTG in November. Turning first to document JOB/DEV/45, he said that the communication aimed to identify the fundamental differences between e-commerce and traditional trade in the context of the so-called Òatoms-bits transformationÓ For the digital-trade world, it was more important to think about how to remove trade barriers for bits rather than atoms. Additionally, it was essential to have a better understanding of the new features of trade under the digital revolution. With regard to the second communication, contained in document JOB/DEV/46, he said that it presented major difficulties associated with e-commerce market access. These difficulties included accessibility, connectivity, and transparency. The accessibility issue addressed whether each ecommerce operator had an equal opportunity of being seen online, and thus had access to potential customers. The connectivity difficulty related to the lack of sufficient infrastructure to connect to potential buyers or sellers. The transparency difficulty referred to regulatory barriers, whereby the requirements to comply with different regulations and standards induced significant costs for e-commerce operators. He went on to stress the importance of reciprocal equal access and the removal of accessibility blocks in order to ensure greater fairness. Increasing access to ICT infrastructure was also a key factor in addressing the digital divide, while making regulations transparent were important to businesses preparing to enter into possible future markets. In closing, he indicated that the two communications were not relevant to e-commerce discussions in the context of MC11, but aimed simply at clarifying some fundamental issues relating to ecommerce, while facilitating future discussions at the WTO.  72. && The representative of India recognized that e-commerce had become a major driver of international economic activity and international trade. In India, e-commerce was transforming the way business was being conducted, and represented one of the fastest growing segments of the economy. However, the growth of e-commerce activities had given birth to new challenges, both for domestic and cross-border trade. These included issues relating to consumer protection, the sale of counterfeit goods and services, the safety of online payments, e-authentication procedures and digital signatures, taxation, as well as other challenges relating to shortages of skilled manpower, human resource development and logistics. As rules on these issues were still evolving in most developing countries, his delegation believed that it was premature to discuss rule-making on e-commerce at the WTO. Instead, discussions on e-commerce should be exploratory and confined to the non-negotiating mandate of the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. Since the WTO bodies mandated to implement the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce had highlighted a number of technical issues which still required deliberation, he believed that Members should endeavour to expedite discussions on these issues. 73. His delegation was not in favour of setting up a horizontal mechanism such as a Working Group on E-Commerce, as this could result in a top-down approach. He highlighted the merits of the bottom-up approach reflected in the Nairobi Ministerial Decision, which called for work on ecommerce to continue based on the existing mandate and guidelines, and on the basis of proposals submitted by Members in the relevant WTO bodies. Concerning the issue of the venue for discussion, his delegation felt that the General Council was already mandated to discuss all cross-cutting issues relating to e-commerce. He pointed to the importance of not confusing the gains from e-commerce with the likely benefits of rule-making on e-commerce, as doing so could leave many Members behind. He also indicated that discussion on e-commerce in the CTD needed to focus on how to address the development needs of developing countries. In closing, he said that the existing Work Programme on Electronic Commerce was comprehensive in scope, and allowed for an examination of all trade issues relating to global e-commerce, taking into account the economic, financial and development needs of developing countries. Given that the growth of digital trade and e-commerce were technology-dependent, a critical component of discussions had to be on how to ensure an adequate transfer of technology.   74. && The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, indicated that the Group had submitted a communication contained in JOB/GC/144, which reflected the Group's views on deviating from the current structure of the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce and its exploratory nature. She urged Members to engage substantively in the ongoing process led by the Chairman of the General Council on the future of work on e-commerce.75. She requested that the statement delivered by the African Group at the June 2017 CTD meeting be reflected in the minutes of the present meeting.  76. This statement, as reflected in the Minutes of the 103rd session of the CTD, went as follows: The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, recalled that the African Group had been approaching the exploratory discussions under the Work Programme on E-commerce from a perspective that had given paramount importance to the development implications of ecommerce, taking into account the economic, financial, and development needs of developing countries. She indicated that the Group would be interested in an exchange of views and experiences on the basis of the current Work Programme on E-commerce. For the Group, the immediate priority of the Committee should be a fuller assessment of the wide-ranging disruptions that would result from the fourth industrial revolution, the growth of digital trade and e-commerce. In that respect, discussions in the CTD under the Work Programme should take up issues that would prioritize the needs of developing countries and LDCs, especially the challenges to and ways of enhancing their participation in e-commerce. For exporters of electronically delivered products, these challenges included, inter alia, the improvement of access to infrastructure and transfer of technology, as well as the movement of natural persons.77. She went on to suggest that discussion on e-commerce should be framed around measures that foster inclusion and equitable development for all developing and least developed countries. Specifically for the African Group, critical areas of interest for future discussion on e-commerce included the reality of increasing digital inequality, the importance of digital rights, the existing extremely high market concentration levels in the current global e-commerce space, and the range of attempts at a national level to shape digital flows in order to influence trade and affect national digital catch-up. Addressing these issues would help African governments explore their own policy options, with a view to achieving AfricaÕs longstanding developmental objectives of industrial development, structural transformation and employment, in the context of the profound changes brought on by the so-called "Fourth Industrial Revolution".78. && The representative of South Africa indicated that the tabling of submissions in the CTD was in line with paragraph 1.1 of the 1998 Work Programme, and consistent with paragraph 1 of the Nairobi Decision on e-commerce. She said that continental integration, structural transformation and industrialization were the overriding priorities for Africa, as had been laid out by African Trade Ministers. She made reference in this regard to the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA), as well as to Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, and emphasized the need for work undertaken at the multilateral level to support AfricaÕs continental integration agenda. With regard to e-commerce, she said that the African Group approached the exploratory discussions under the 1998 Work Programme from a perspective that gave paramount importance to the development implications of e-commerce, taking into account the economic, financial, and development needs of developing countries. In this light, she believed that several issues that were included in the proposals under consideration were better suited for discussion in the CTG, the CTS or the TRIPS Council. Furthermore, some of the issues fell outside the scope of the 1998 Work Programme, or were being taken up extensively in other international organizations. She urged the proponents to refine their proposals in order to make them specific to the body where discussions should take place, as per the Work Programme.379. She went on to say that the African Group wanted the CTD to take up issues that placed at their centre the needs of developing countries and LDCs. She highlighted in this regard the importance of addressing ways of enhancing the participation of developing countries in ecommerce, and the associated challenges. A number of examples were provided, including with respect to infrastructure, industrialization and workforce skills. It was noted that the potential benefits of e-commerce for developing countries could not be assumed or asserted. It was pointed out, inter alia, in this regard that fixed broadband penetration remained at 0.7% in Africa and the LDCs, and Africa was the only region in the world where broadband penetration remained below 20%. Bringing about socially equalizing effects would not be possible when only some had access to digital technology Ð whilst others had partial or no access, and also had no rights over the technology. According to the UNCTAD, four countries accounted for 80% of business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, which was the largest form of e-trade. With regard to business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce, the Middle East and Africa together accounted for only 2.5%. Accordingly, discussions in the CTD had to address the asymmetrical nature of the existing global e-commerce space, in order to enable Africa to become e-commerce ready. One of the overriding questions of the African Group was how to build an inclusive growth and equitable development trajectory for all developing countries and LDCs. She encouraged Members to share their experiences on measures employed to develop capabilities in the digital economy. In closing, she expressed the commitment of the African Group to engage in a comprehensive discussion in the CTD on all issues relating to the development implications of e-commerce.80. In closing her intervention, the representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, highlighted some elements of the African Group's statement delivered on the March 2017 CTD meeting, and reflected above. She noted that a number of issues contained in the proposals on e-commerce would be better suited for a discussion in the other relevant bodies, such as the CTG, the CTS and the TRIPS Council. This statement also indicated that at least two submissions on e-commerce did not cover the most important elements in the Work Programme under development. Furthermore, some of the issues fell outside the scope of the 1998 Work Programme, or were being taken up extensively in other international organizations. Therefore, the proponents were urged to refine their proposals in order to make them specific to the body where discussions should take place, as per the Work Programme.81. && The Committee took note of all interventions.  H. NOTIFICATIONS UNDER THE TRANSPARENCY MECHANISM FOR PREFERENTIAL TRADE ARRANGEMENTS82. && The Chairman said that he wished to provide Members with a brief update on the PTAs that were to be considered in Dedicated Sessions of the CTD. He firstly informed Members that the factual presentation on the US' trade preferences for Nepal was circulated on 13 November in document WT/COMTD/PTA/3/1. Members would soon be invited to submit any questions they might have on this PTA, which would be considered in a Dedicated Session in 2018. With regard to other PTAs that had been notified since the establishment of the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs, he said that the situation had not substantially changed since his last report. In particular, there were five PTAs for which the Secretariat had still not received the full set of data or information required for the preparation of factual presentations. These were the PTAs being implemented by China, India, the Russian Federation, Thailand and Chinese Taipei. He urged the notifying Members to provide the required data and information as soon as possible. In closing, he repeated what he had said earlier concerning the informal consultation convened on 2ÊOctoberÊ2017 with the Members that had yet to submit the full set of data or information regarding the RTAs and PTAs they had notified. In particular, he recalled that representatives from the Secretariat were present at the consultation to clarify the data and information requirements, and to answer any questions. He once again expressed his hope that the consultation had proven useful, and that it would help to expedite the submission of the required data and information.83. && The Committee took note of the Chairman's update. I. ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE STEPS TAKEN TO PROVIDE DUTY-FREE AND QUOTA-FREE MARKET ACCESS TO LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES84. && The Chairman said that the Bali Decision on DFQF market access for LDCs, contained in documents WT/MIN(13)/44 and WT/L/919, instructed the CTD to continue to annually review the steps taken to provide Duty-free and Quota-free (DFQF) market access to the LDCs, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. To aid in the review, the Secretariat was instructed to prepare, in close coordination with Members, a report on Members' DFQF market access for LDCs, at the tariff line level based on their notifications. Accordingly, a Secretariat report on DFQF had been prepared annually since the Bali Ministerial Conference. Given that the report needed to be prepared in close coordination with Members, the practice these past years had been for the Secretariat to circulate a draft report, which was considered by Members at an informal, open-ended meeting and subsequently circulated for discussion at the last formal session of the year. 85. However, as he had explained at the informal, open-ended meeting held on 6ÊNovemberÊ2017, because of a divergence of views between some Members on the scope and coverage of the report, the Secretariat was not able to circulate its report for consideration at the present session. In spite of the discussion that had taken place in a small-group consultation that he had convened just before the informal, open-ended meeting on 6 November, these divergent views remained. In particular, Bangladesh's position on what should be the scope and coverage of the report remained unchanged from what had been outlined at the 100th Session. The position was that references in the Secretariat report to two preference programmes being implemented by the United States Ð namely, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) Ð went beyond the scope of the report, because these were not intended specifically or exclusively for the LDCs. Although these preference programmes had been referenced in previous Secretariat reports, Bangladesh's view was that they should henceforth not be included. The United States' position, on the other hand, was that these programmes were benefiting some LDCs. They were therefore relevant to the scope and coverage of the Secretariat report, and should be maintained. He explained that, while his informal consultations had helped to clarify Members' positions, they had not permitted the situation to be unblocked. It was for this reason that there was no Secretariat report for consideration at the present meeting. Nevertheless, an item concerning the CTD's annual DFQF review was included on the agenda, and Members could therefore have a discussion on the matter.86. && The representative of Bangladesh expressed disappointment that the Secretariat had not been able to circulate its annual DFQF report for consideration by the CTD. Recalling that his delegation had already shared its views on this matter in 2016, he indicated that his expectation had been that Members would have realized the importance and relevance of the observations made by Bangladesh, and would have reached consensus on the report. He reminded Members of the language contained in the Hong Kong and Bali DFQF Decisions, and indicated that the scope and objective of the Secretariat report on DFQF market access for LDCs were clear. In particular, his delegation believed that the report had to focus on the steps taken to implement these two decisions. While his delegation appreciated that some Members were providing preferential market access to groups of developing countries, which sometimes included LDCs, it was questionable whether these initiatives should be included in the Secretariat report. He believed that an important consideration in this regard was whether there was a declaration of intent in these preferential schemes to support LDCs. If there was a declaration of intent, then there might be merit in including such schemes in the report, if all Members were agreeable. However, if there was no declaration of intent to support LDCs, there was no reason to include these schemes in the report, as doing so would undermine the purpose and objective of the report. In this regard, he pointed specifically to AGOA and CBTPA, since his delegation was convinced that these schemes did not contain such a declaration of intent. Given that the purpose and objective of the report required specificity as to which schemes should be referred to, he shared his delegation's view that the report needed be prepared without a mention of AGOA or CBTPA. 87. && The representative of the United States appreciated the Chairman's efforts to try and find a solution that was acceptable to all Members. He said that his delegation could continue to accept the compromise that it had accepted in the three previous years, which was to include in a table the US' Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme, supplemented with additional text in a footnote which clarified the United States' preference schemes. Consideration could also be given to the possibility of deleting the acronym GSP from the title of the table, and listing the three additional US programmes Ð AGOA, CBTPA and the trade preferences for Nepal Ð in the body of the table, given that all these programmes were notified to the WTO and appeared in the Database on PTAs. However, the United States could not join consensus to approve a report that would not provide specific information on all of the US' preference programmes that had LDC beneficiaries, as doing so would be misleading and unfair. Recalling the language from the Bali DFQF Decision which instructed the Secretariat to prepare a report on Members' DFQF market access for LDCs, he stressed that the purpose of the report was to provide transparency. If Bangladesh could not stand by the previous compromise on the report, the United States would not hold itself to that compromise either. He recalled that the Bali DFQF Decision used the language "for LDCs", and not "the LDCs" or "all LDCs". This meant that any notified scheme that benefitted any LDC should be included not only in the text of the report, but also in the table. Additionally, his delegation would reject any proposal to include Members' opinions of other Members' schemes in a Secretariat report, as this would be inappropriate and would call into question the Secretariat's neutrality. 88. && The representative of the European Union recalled that the European Union provided DFQF market access for all products from LDCs, except for arms and ammunition. This made the European Union the most important destination for LDC agricultural and manufactured products. She also indicated that the EU's GSP scheme, as revised in 2014, had reduced the number of beneficiaries, thus generating more space for LDC exports. She welcomed the progress in the provision of DFQF market access by both developed and developing Members. It was noted in this regard that most developed countries were now providing close to full DFQF market access for LDC products. Her delegation additionally welcomed the growing number of emerging economies that were providing preferential treatment to LDC products, and encouraged them to continue to do so in light of their growing importance as a destination for LDC exports. 89. && The representative of India said that he wished to repeat the position that his delegation had expressed at the small-group informal consultation held on 6 November, as well as at the informal, open-ended meeting held on the same day. In particular, he supported the views expressed by Bangladesh, and indicated that his delegation was not convinced of the relevance of AGOA and CBTPA for the Secretariat report. 90. && The Chairman encouraged Members to continue to discuss the matter in order to find a way forward. He expressed his hope that a compromise could be found, so as to allow the Secretariat report to be issued in future years for the benefit of Members.91. && The Committee took note of all interventions.J. PARTICIPATION OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM (WT/COMTD/W/230) 92. && The Chairman said that the CTD had a mandate to keep under continuous review the participation of developing country Members in the MTS. He recalled that it had been agreed at the 101st Session that the CTD's discussion under this agenda item would take place after the Secretariat update on the participation of developing economies in the global trading system was completed. He informed the Committee that the update had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/230, and invited representatives of the Economic Research and Statistics Division (ERSD) to briefly introduce the report.93. In their presentation, the representatives of the ERSD provided a broad overview of the information contained in the Secretariat paper. With respect to trade developments over the 20142016 period, it was noted, inter alia, that developing economies' share of merchandise export and imports had declined by 1 percentage point, and stood respectively at 42.5% and 39.7% in 2016. Weak economic activity in both developed and developing regions Ð coupled with the fall in energy and commodity prices Ð explained a decline in export earnings, which had also reduced the capacity of some developing economies to import. African and Middle Eastern economies had been particularly affected by the fall in merchandise exports, while the export contraction in developing economies in Asia and Europe was less pronounced. South-South trade continued to account for an important share of developing economies' merchandise trade Ð around 50%. This was mainly explained by the key role of trade in manufactured products, particularly between Asian economies. With respect to commercial services, the Committee was informed that developing economies' contribution to world exports of commercial services had risen from 29.9% in 2014 to 30.5% in 2016, while developing economies' participation in world imports of commercial services had increased from 38% to 38.3%. Although weak merchandise trade and overcapacity in the shipping sector had led to heavy losses in the transport sector of developing economies, enhanced air connectivity and cheaper air fares had allowed developing economies to benefit from 41 million more tourists in 2016 relative to 2014. China played a leading role in boosting the tourism sector growth in neighbouring Asian economies, while Northern African economies had experienced a drop in travel earnings. It was noted that Asian economies were the main contributors to developing economies' participation in the other commercial services category.94. An overview was also provided of the participation of developing economies in global value chains (GVCs), based on the data available in the Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database, which was maintained by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the WTO. It was explained that participation in GVCs could be broken down into backward participation Ð corresponding to the value added from inputs that were imported in order to produce intermediate or final goods and services for export Ð and forward participation, which captured the domestic value added contained in inputs sent to third economies for further processing and exporting through a value chain. The GVC participation index, derived from the TiVA database, illustrated the multiple value added exchanges taking place within international production. The report provided information on the total forward and backward participation of the developing economies available in the TiVA database, as well as information on participation in the computer, electronic and optical equipment industry. The data showed that the Philippines played a major role in electronics supply chains, with 30% of its trade in that sector taking place within GVCs. In general, the countries showing the highest degree of vertical specialization had low forward participation in GVCs, which confirmed their focus on activities at the end of the information technology (IT) and electronics production chains. This was the case for East Asian economies like Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam, as well as for economies such as China and Mexico where processing trade was predominant. Korea and Chinese Taipei showed strong participation in ITrelated GVCs, while the development of Costa Rica within GVCs was largely due to the presence of global technology corporations in the country. Among African economies in the TiVA database, Morocco was the most involved in electronics GVCs. In addition, using traditional trade statistics, it was shown that some labour-intensive final assembly activities in Asia had shifted from China to other low-cost neighbouring economies.   95. && The representative of the United States believed that it was necessary to go beyond aggregate data when considering the information in the Secretariat report. He noted that the report described how specific changes affected certain regions. For example, the fall in energy prices affected some regions more than others. In addition, giving examples from Africa, he observed that experiences differed even within a particular region. Finally, he observed that half of trade between developing economies was attributable to exports to other developing economies, and in this regard underlined the importance of South-South trade.96. && The representative of the European Union expressed appreciation for the information contained in the Secretariat report and echoed the suggestion by the United States to go beyond aggregate data when reading the report. She welcomed the information provided on the participation of developing economies in GVCs.97. && The representative of Japan said that the report contained factual information on developing economies' involvement in global trade and in GVCs. She noted that a realistic picture of global trade could be provided through the use of the TiVA database, and pointed in particular to the snapshots of Asian value chains. She went on to say that trading was no longer about final consumer goods. Technology Ð particularly ICT Ð had expanded connectivity, and had made it possible to share information and communication in factories in different countries, and to provide services across the globe. ICT also allowed MSMEs to gain access to the global market. She recalled that, in 2017, Members had discussed these realities on various occasions Ð including at the Aid-for-Trade Global Review, during which many key aspects were highlighted, such as the importance of private resource mobilization, trade facilitation, digital trade, and a good regulatory environment with policy consistency and transparency. In closing, she expressed hope that this exchange of ideas and best practices would be pursued, in order to make trade more inclusive and achieve worldwide sustainable economic growth. 98. A representative of the ERSD said that the Secretariat was working on the development of quality statistics, with a view to improving the coverage of the TiVA database. It was hoped that the updated database would help generate additional information concerning the participation of developing economies in GVCs.99. && The Committee took note of the Secretariat paper, and of all interventions.   K. DRAFT ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2017 (WT/COMTD/W/231)100. && The Chairman recalled that a fax was sent to Members on 8 November 2017, indicating that the CTD's draft annual report had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/231. It was noted that the draft contained a number of square brackets relating to some items, including with respect to discussions to take place at the present meeting. The square brackets would be removed as part of the process of adopting the report, and the discussion that had taken place at the present meeting would be appropriately reflected in the report. Noting that Members had been requested to submit in writing any comments on the draft annual report by 13 November 2017, he informed the Committee that no substantive comments had been received on the report.  101. && The Committee adopted its annual report for 2017.4L. OTHER BUSINESS102. && The Chairman recalled that, at the beginning of the meeting, the United States had indicated that it wished to raise some concerns relating to procedural matters, and had requested that CTD agendas be henceforth circulated four weeks in advance of a meeting, as laid out in the CTD's rules of procedure. He recalled that he had suggested that these issues could be taken up under "Other Business". However, he understood that the United States had already had the opportunity to make its interventions earlier in the meeting. 103. && The representative of the United States confirmed that his delegation had already had the opportunity to make its interventions earlier in the meeting.104. && The Chairman said that he wished to say a few words for the benefit of Members on the timeframe for the issuance of agendas for CTD meetings. He noted that the practice in the CTD for several years now had been to issue agendas ten days before a meeting, similar to what was mentioned in the General Council's rules of procedure. However, the CTD's rules of procedure, contained in document WT/COMTD/6 Ð and which was to be read in conjunction with the General Council's rules of procedure contained in document WT/L/161 Ð did indeed specify a four-week period for the issuance of meeting notices. He referred in particular to Rules 2, 3 and 4 of the CTD's rules of procedure, and observed that adherence to these rules would mean that the agenda for a meeting would close four weeks before a meeting, and documentation for the meeting would also need to be circulated before the agenda was issued. He noted that this would require quite a bit of advance preparation for Members and the Secretariat. 105. && The representative of the United States indicated that he wished to share some information on the practices in other WTO bodies. He noted in particular that, in some cases, while a draft agenda was issued a number of weeks in advance of a meeting, this did not necessarily mean the close of the agenda. The closing of the official agenda was still ten days prior to the meeting. This was a way for Members to be informed of what could be expected to be on the agenda of a meeting several weeks in advance, but without facing a situation in which the agenda was already closed. 106. && The Chairman recalled that he had indicated at the beginning of the meeting that he wished to raise a matter under "Other Business" concerning the work being carried out by the Secretariat on a publication titled "Mainstreaming Trade in the Sustainable Development Goals". He informed the Committee that the Secretariat publication would offer insights on the role of trade and the WTO in achieving the SDGs in all three dimensions: economic, social and environmental. It would also provide guidance on how to mainstream trade to expand economic opportunities for poverty reduction, and how countries could get organized to deliver on the SDGs. Work on the publication was well advanced, and the Secretariat was aiming to launch it in the first half of 2018. Members could consider inviting the Secretariat to make a presentation of the publication at a future CTD meeting.107. && The Committee took note of all interventions.108. The meeting was adjourned.__________           1 The discussion concerning documents WT/COMTD/W/208 and WT/COMTD/W/192 is presented together in this Note, since the Chairman noted in the course of the discussion under the first sub-item that Members' interventions related to both submissions, and in this light invited continued interventions on both submissions together.           2 The discussion with respect to the three sub-items is presented together in this Note, since the Chairman noted in the course of the discussion under the first sub-item that Members' interventions related to all three sub-items, and in this light invited continued interventions on the three sub-items together.           3 The points in this paragraph, and the following two paragraphs, were originally made at the 101st Session of the CTD. They were subsequently reflected in the Minutes of the 103rd Session at the request of the delegation of South Africa.            4 The report was issued in document WT/COMTD/96 and WT/COMTD/96/Corr.1. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WT/COMTD/M/97- 1 -WT/COMTD/M/104- 20 -  RESTRICTEDWT/COMTD/M/10419 March 2018(18-1644)Page: 1/21Committee on Trade and Development104th Session
